# Macchiato Monsters

Character sheet for [Macchiato Monsters](http://quenouille.com/macchiato-monsters-dungeonverse-build-together/), by [Natha](https://github.com/NathaTerrien/roll20-wip/blob/master/README.md), designed with the author, Eric Nieudan, and with graphic elements by Guillaume Jentey.

Macchiato Monsters is a rules-light, old school, slightly collaborative roleplaying game. Brewing two hacks to get the perfect cup of DIY dungeonverse! Macchiato Monsters features simple roll-under resolution, omnipresent risk dice, streamlined combat, freeform characters, and no spell list.
