    "instructions": "All attributes and skills have an associated modifier field and a note field for explaining the source of the modifier. So if you have an amp that adds +1 to AGI, put '1' in the modifier field for AGI, note which amp the modifier came from, and the modifier will be automatically included in computed skill totals and rolls.\r\rWhen marking damage, check the appropriate hit boxes as you would on the official character sheet--left to right and top down. The associated roll modifier displayed next to the stun/physical track will be automatically applied to displayed skill totals and to rolls. Checking more boxes than you technically have according to attribute/armor values will not break the character sheet, but it is up to you to keep track of when you've reached your hit limit in a category (displayed as 'of [...]' to the lower right of a hit track)."
