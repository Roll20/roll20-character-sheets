Stormbringer Character Sheet
======================================

This character sheet is designed for ease of navigationâ€”everything is on one sheet, with a similar layout to the standard Stormbringer 4e character sheet.

Roll Buttons: Roll buttons have been added for Weapons (attack + damage in one button), and all skills represented on the charactersheet (as well as any added via the Repeating Section buttons).

Customization: The Hit Points by Location section of the sheet can be customized slightly. The section can be shown or hidden. The image can be swapped between a slender person or a muscular person, and the ranges for each location can be modified. The Wounds Notes and Afflictions boxes will always show.
