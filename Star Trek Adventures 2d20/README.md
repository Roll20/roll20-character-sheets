### [Changelog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Roll20/roll20-character-sheets/master/Star Trek Adventures 2d20/changelog.md)

## Sheet Releases
When I release a new version, it takes time to reach the public. Roll20 must merge my changes (typically Mondays/Tuesdays) and then release the code to the public (typically Tuesdays/Wednesdays). You can track [Roll20's pull requests on their github](https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-character-sheets/pulls). I have no control over when they release.

## How to Update the sheet yourself (as Pro):

1. Copy the [html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GrumpyOldDM/STA_DemoSheet/master/Star%20Trek%20Adventures%202d20.html) from GitHub
2. In Roll20 go to campaign settings and choose a custom character sheet.
3. In the HTML tab paste the HTML code
4. Copy the [css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GrumpyOldDM/STA_DemoSheet/master/Star%20Trek%20Adventures%202d20.css) from GitHub
5. On Roll20 in the CSS tab paste the CSS code.
6. Hit save.

*If you are ever concerned about data loss I recommend you duplicate your campaign and use that to copy to see how it'll work. *

## Testing new versions
I regularly release new versions. If you'd like to be involved in the testing period follow this thread. You can also see the latest code on [Star Trek Adventures (Workshop)](https://app.roll20.net/join/2363663/M4ln3Q)
