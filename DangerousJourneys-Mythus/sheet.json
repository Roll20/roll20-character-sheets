One is for Heroic Personas and the other is for Everybody Else.  There is a script in Rev0.96 and later which SHOULD automatically upgrade old characters to deal with this, but in case you open an old character and end up with a blank page instead, you may need to go into Attributes and Abilities and manually create and set an attribute called \"personahide\" to 1.\n On Add of new character, please wait about 20-30 seconds for initialization.  When Heka Aperture goes to -10 and the Heka Limitations disappear, you're probably there.\n  See Guide and Informational document about this sheet at https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-character-sheets/tree/master/DangerousJourneys-Mythus/accessories/DangerousJourneysCharSheetInfo.rtf  You can type all armor, weapons, Castings, and Powers in manually or use the import buttons; an Excel 2016 sheet is found in the repository at https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-character-sheets/tree/master/DangerousJourneys-Mythus/accessories/roll20_import_generator2.xlsx .  Note that this Excel workbook is not a character generator and does not pretend to be, but is instead a reference for the import syntax in case someone wishes to develop an HP generator outside Roll20. \n  Caveat Emptor.",
