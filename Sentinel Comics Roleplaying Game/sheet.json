  "instructions": "Welcome to the official sheet for the Sentinel Comics Roleplaying Game! This sheet goes beyond your character, with support for hero, villain, environment, minion squad, challenge, and scene tracker sheets. Just create a new one, pick the type of sheet, and get going. Hero and Villain sheets provide access to ability libraries so you can quickly add options from the RPG. Minion management tools exist wherever you might need them, whether in free-standing squads, or on villain and hero sheets. Hero sheets include support for various modes for building shapeshifters and other multi-form characters. This sheet is an official alternative to the existing community-created sheet and is not cross-compatible. Got feedback for us? Drop us a line at roll20@greaterthangames.com."
