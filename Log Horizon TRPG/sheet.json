I apologize for the inconvenience.\r\r Some things to know beforehand:\r For people who used the old sheet, you are going to run into some issues.(Anyone else can disregard the next paragraph. \r\r First of all, to avoid compatibility issues altogether I would suggest starting with a fresh sheet, but if that's not an option here are the issues I'm currently aware of.\r* Checks on all skills get reset to 'None'.\r* Attack, Magic and Recovery are now auto-calculated based on equipment stats and bonuses added manually in the 'Bonuses' section. You will need to go into the 'Attributes & Abilities' section and delete the old Attack, Magic and Recovery values. If you don't do this, then any skill rolls which reference them will get the old values instead of the new.\r\r Side note: The previews on skills and equipment do not like it when you mix letters and numbers. I haven't run into a case where this became a problem, but if you do need to put a number in a Skill name for example, you could simply use roman letters (I, II, III, IV, etc.) \n\n [Readme&Changelog](https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-character-sheets/blob/master/Log%20Horizon%20TRPG/README.md)",
