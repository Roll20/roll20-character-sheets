# Shadowrun 2nd Edition Character Sheet

This character sheet was made for use with Roll20.net, and the 2nd edition of the Shadowrun ruleset. The sheet uses the core rulebook, as well as portions of a few additional sourcebooks; more functionality may be added later.

This sheet is designed to be functional for any level of subscription, but API helper scripts are also in production, in particular for initiative.

## Feedback

If you have problems, or suggestions for the sheet, feel free to log an issue on the github repository, or by private message on roll20 (https://app.roll20.net/users/175628/crazion-d). Have patience for a response, I am only able to work on these sheets in my limited spare time, and may not even get a chance to check for these messages more than one per week.
