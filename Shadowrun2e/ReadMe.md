# Shadowrun 2nd Edition Character Sheet

This character sheet was made for use with Roll20.net, and the 2nd edition of the Shadowrun ruleset. The sheet uses the core rulebook, as well as portions of a few additional sourcebooks; more functionality may be added later.

This sheet is designed to be functional for any level of subscription, but API helper scripts are also in production, in particular for initiative.

All Condition monitors (Physical, Stun, Vehicle, Drone, Deck, etc) all apply TN mods to appropiate skills.

Skill Section added to Deck, Vehicle and Drone, so when decking, drving atc, no flicking between tabs to the skill section.

Two columns for Programs to be listed by deckers to avoid a long page scroll.

This sheet has been vastly changed and adapted from the original, and have been working on it for a
a few months now in my spare time. It has been fixed and made into a workable sheet.

Many parts have been upgraded and/or added such as new tabs, a major retool on the look of the sheet. 
It has used code from the original creator as well as others and myself.

NEW TABS  - General/Lifestyle (Attributes and lifestyle section)
          - Skills/Edges/Flaws (all in one area for easy access)
          - Magic and Spells (Spells Tables and area for recording spell desrcriptions if needed,
          - Physical adept Section and NEW Shaman section)
          - Decks (no Change)
          - Gear (Better layout for Gear Cyberware/Bioware)
          - Vehicles/Drones (no change)
          - Combat (ALL combat related stuff in this section, including weapons, easier to detrmine
            modifiers and working out damage etc without having to switch Tabs)

-All dice rolls now have a dice template attached to them making it easier to see in Roll20.

-Sheet is a working sheet as it has been tested by players and myself.

-Weapons and Spells table was added

Unfortunatly no logo as I was working on this before update below.
I do intend to maintain and upkeep this sheet.



### 26th January 2021
Added by [RafaelLVX](https://app.roll20.net/users/2403046/rafaellvx).

- Multiple visual fixes, including broken columns, dislodged fields and buttons.
- Added game logo.
- Added cool table styling to weapons, skills and spells repeating sections as suggested [here](https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/3149948/repeating-section-issue). [This](https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/9483852/repeating-sections-in-tables) is another possible solution to displaying confusing fieldsets in neat columns, but although a grid is generally more elegant, you'd need a separate class for each table if they have a different number of columns.
- Fixed typos.
- Cleaned up code. Among other things: removed escaped tags, added double quotes where there were single or no quotes, added semicolon at the end of CSS declarations.
- Fixed problematic code such as "width=100px" which was present both on HTML and CSS.
- Replaced inline styles with new classes (though many are still to be done).

No script/sheetworkers were touched, no calculation and rolls should be affected (they were working fine as far as I can tell). There's still a lot of room for improvement.

### 18th September 2018
- roll button icons changed to d6 from default d20

### 11th February 2016
- Initial release version

## Feedback

If you have problems, or suggestions for the sheet, feel free to log an issue on the github repository, or by private message on roll20 (https://app.roll20.net/users/175628/crazion-d). Have patience for a response, I am only able to work on these sheets in my limited spare time, and may not even get a chance to check for these messages more than one per week.
