    "instructions": "**Fallout 3.5**\rWhole Sheet: I changed skills like repair, science, outdoorsman and speech. Then created many skills for them. I did that because skills like science can be very tricky. Hacking was under it, craftings were under it. So now they have own skills. \rPrime Tab: Included fire resistance, height value for character and changed sp per level value for purpose of increased amount of skills. \rSkill tab: Fixed some bugs for earlier 3.0 sheet and added new skills along with tag skill. So tagging skill will increase that skill for 20. \rTrait tab: Changed the name of this tab as perks. \rInventoryTab: Location name has changed with amount."
