# D&D 5e Shaped Character Sheet

This is the redesigned Shaped character sheet for use on Roll20.net with the 5th edition of Dungeons & Dragons (5e). The sheet is designed to be usable by all Roll20 users regardless of subscription level.

*If you are ever concerned about data loss I recommend you duplicate your campaign and use that to copy to see how it'll work.*
