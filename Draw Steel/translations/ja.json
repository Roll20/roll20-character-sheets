When an ability allows you to create an area of effect, you are sometimes given a distance, noted as 'within X', that describes how many squares away from you the area can be. If an area ability doesn’t originate from you, then at least 1 square of the area of effect must be within that distance and your line of effect. This square is referred to as the origin square of the area of effect. The area of effect can spread from the origin square however you choose, as long as the area of effect conforms to the shape and arrangement rules of that particular area. Unless otherwise noted, area abilities don’t pass through solid barriers such as walls or ceilings, or spread around corners. As long as you have line of effect and distance to the origin square, you can place an area ability to include one or more squares where you don’t have line of effect.",
	"aura": "Aura:",
	"aura-desc": "When an ability creates an aura, that area is expressed as 'X aura'. The number X is the radius of the aura, which always originates from you and moves with you for the duration of the ability that created it. A creature or object must be within X squares of you to be targeted with an aura ability.",
	"burst": "Burst:",
	"burst-desc": "When an ability creates a burst area, that area is expressed as 'X burst'. The number X is the radius of the burst, which always originates from you and lasts only for as long as it takes to affect its targets. A creature or object must be within X squares of you to be targeted with a burst ability.",
	"cube": "Cube:",
	"cube-desc": "When an ability affects a cubic area, that area is expressed as 'X cube'. The number X is the length of each of the area’s sides. A creature or object must be within the area to be targeted with a cube ability.",
	"line": "Line:",
	"line-desc": "When an ability affects a linear area, that area is expressed as 'A × B line'. The number A denotes the line's length in squares, while the number B equals the line’s width and height in squares. When you create a line area of effect, the squares in that area must be in a straight line. A creature or object must be within the area to be targeted with a line ability.",
	"wall-director": "Wall:",
	"wall-desc": "When an ability creates a wall, that area is expressed as 'X wall'. The number X is how many squares are used to make the wall. When you place a wall, you can build it one square at a time, but each square must share at least one side (not just a corner) with another square of the wall. A creature or object must be within the area to be targeted with a wall ability. You can stack squares on top of each other to make the wall higher. Unless otherwise stated, a wall can’t be placed in occupied squares, and a wall blocks line of effect.",
	"conditions-desc": "Some abilities and other effects apply specific negative effects called conditions to a creature. The following conditions show up regularly in the game and can be tracked on your character sheet",
	"bleeding": "Bleeding:",
	"bleeding-desc": "While a creature is bleeding, whenever they use a main action, use a triggered action, or make a test or ability power roll using Might or Agility, they lose Stamina equal to 1d6 + their level after the main action, triggered action, or power roll is resolved. This Stamina loss can’t be prevented in any way.<br>You take damage from this condition when you use a main action you use off your turn. For example, a signature attack used as a free triggered action with the assistance of the tactician's Strike Now ability triggers the damage from the bleeding condition.",
	"dazed": "Dazed:",
	"dazed-desc": "A creature who is dazed can do only one thing on their turn: use a main action, use a maneuver, or use a move action. A dazed creature also can’t use triggered actions, free triggered actions, or free maneuvers.",
	"frightened": "Frightened:",
	"frightened-desc": "When a creature is frightened, any ability roll they make against the source of their fear takes a bane. If that source is a creature, their ability rolls made against the frightened creature gain an edge. A frightened creature can’t willingly move closer to the source of their fear if they know the location of that source. If a creature gains the frightened condition from one source while already frightened by a different source, the new condition replaces the old one.",
	"grabbed": "Grabbed:",
	"grabbed-desc": "A creature who is grabbed has speed 0, can’t be force moved except by a creature, object, or effect that has them grabbed, cannot use the Knockback maneuver, and takes a bane on abilities that don’t target the creature, object, or effect that has them grabbed. If a creature is grabbed by another creature and that creature moves, they bring the grabbed creature with them. If a creature's size is equal to or less than the size of a creature they have grabbed, their speed is halved while they have that creature grabbed.<br>A creature who has another creature grabbed can use a maneuver to move the grabbed creature into an unoccupied space adjacent to them.<br>A creature can release a creature they have grabbed at any time to end that condition (no action required). A creature targeted by an effect that would grab them can attempt to escape being grabbed using the Escape Grab maneuver. If a grabbed creature teleports, or if either the grabbed creature or the creature grabbing them is force moved so that both creatures are no longer adjacent to each other, that creature is no longer grabbed.<br>A creature can grab only creatures of their size or smaller. If a creature's Might score is 2 or higher, they can grab any creature larger than them with a size equal to or less than their Might score.<br>Unless otherwise indicated, a creature can grab only one creature at a time.",
	"prone": "Prone:",
	"prone-desc": "While a creature is prone, they are flat on the ground, any strike they make takes a bane, and melee abilities used against them gain an edge. A prone creature must crawl to move along the ground, which costs 1 additional square of movement for every square crawled. A creature can’t climb, jump, swim, or fly while prone. If they are climbing, flying, or jumping when knocked prone, they fall.<br>Unless the ability or effect that imposed the prone condition says otherwise, a prone creature can stand up using the Stand Up maneuver. A creature adjacent to a willing prone creature can likewise use the Stand Up maneuver to make that creature stand up.",
	"restrained": "Restrained:",
	"restrained-desc": "A creature who is restrained has speed 0, can’t use the Stand Up maneuver, and can’t be force moved. A restrained creature takes a bane on ability rolls and on Might and Agility tests, and abilities used against them gain an edge.<br>If a creature teleports while restrained, that condition ends.",

	"taunted": "Taunted:",
	"taunted-desc": "A creature who is taunted has a double bane on ability rolls for any ability that does not target the creature who taunted them, as long as they have line of effect to that creature.

	"weakened": "Weakened:",
	"weakened-desc": "A creature who is weakened takes a bane on power rolls",
	"charge-effect": "When a creature takes the Charge main action, they move up to their speed in a straight line, then make a melee free strike against a target when they end their move. If the creature has an ability with the Charge keyword, they can use that ability against the target instead of a free strike. A creature can’t move through difficult terrain or shift when they charge. They can fly or burrow as part of the Charge main action if they have that movement available to them, but they can’t climb or swim while charging unless they can automatically use that movement at full speed.",
	"defend-effect": "When a creature takes the Defend main action, ability rolls made against them have a double bane until the start of their next turn. Additionally, you have a double edge on tests when called for to resist environmental effects or a creature’s traits or abilities. A creature gains no benefit from this action while another creature is taunted by them.",
	"heal-effect": "A creature who uses the Heal main action employs medicine or inspiring words to make an adjacent creature feel better and stay in the fight. The target creature can spend a Recovery to regain Stamina, or can make a saving throw against one effect they are suffering that is ended by a saving throw.",
	"convert-effect": "You can convert your main action into a maneuver or a move action, allowing you to take two maneuvers or move actions on your turn.",
	"aid-attack-effect": "A creature who uses the Aid Attack maneuver chooses an enemy adjacent to them. The next ability roll an ally makes against that enemy before the start of the aiding creature’s next turn gains an edge.",

	"disengage-effect": "When a creature takes the Disengage move action, they can shift 1 square. Certain class features, kits, and other rules allow a creature to shift more than 1 square when they disengage. A creature who does so can break up their shift with their maneuver and main action however they wish.",
	"ride-effect": "A creature can take the Ride move action only while mounted on another creature. When a creature takes the Ride move action, they cause their mount to move up to the mount’s speed, taking the rider with them. Alternatively, a creature can use the Ride move action to have their mount use the Disengage move action as a free triggered action. A creature can use the Ride move action only once per round. A mounted creature can only have this move action applied to them once per round. This movement can be broken with the rider’s maneuver and main action however they wish.",

	"free-strike-effect": "A melee free strike with a distance of melee 1 or the melee distance of the creature's signature ability, whichever is higher.\n A ranged free strike with a distance of 5 or the ranged distance of the creature’s signature ability, whichever is higher.\n A creature's free strike has the Strike keyword, as well as the Magic, Psionic, or Weapon keywords if those keywords are found in the creature's signature ability. Additionally, if the creature's signature ability deals damage of a specific type, the free strike also uses that damage type. If the creature’s signature ability deals more than one type of damage, you decide which damage type the creature's free strike uses when the strike is made.",
