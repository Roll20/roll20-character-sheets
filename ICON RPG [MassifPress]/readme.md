# ICON RPG Character Sheet for Roll20

Welcome to the full documentation for this unoffocial ICON character sheet.

This sheet is designed for use with the [ICON](https://massif-press.itch.io/icon) system by Massif Press. This is an unofficial sheet made with the aid of Scott C's [K-scaffold](https://kurohyou.github.io/Roll20-Snippets/index.html?v=1.1). Almost all of the core functionality of the game, as of version 1.45, is accessible via this sheet.
Rules reminders are built in and can be hidden or show by clicking orange 'i' in the top right of each section.
The sheet is also flexible enough to hopefully allow for homebrew rules and custom features.
I hope you enjoy!
