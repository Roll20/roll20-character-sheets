This is an unofficial sheet made with the aid of Scott C's [K-scaffold](https://kurohyou.github.io/Roll20-Snippets/index.html?v=1.1). Almost all of the core functionality of the game, as of version 1.45, is accessible via this sheet.\nRules reminders are built in and can be hidden or show by clicking orange 'i' in the top right of each section.\nThe sheet is also flexible enough to hopefully allow for homebrew rules and custom features.\nI hope you enjoy!\n\nRead the [full documentation](https://github.com/Seraaron/roll20-character-sheets/blob/master/ICON%20RPG%20%5BMassifPress%5D/readme.md) or [report a bug](https://github.com/Seraaron/roll20-character-sheets/issues)",
