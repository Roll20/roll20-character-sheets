  "instructions": "#Character Sheet\rWhole Sheet: I am unfamiliar with the game, so the buttons were kept to a minimum.\r*Dossier Tab: Changing the Character name changes the name of the journal.  In the Aptitudes section, the Morph bonuses are drawn from the Morph tab and cannot be altered on the Dossier tab. The stats section does not auto-calculate. \r*Skills Tab: Both the Active skills and Knowledge skills are hidden under the appropreate check box.The first skill in both the Active and Knowledge skill are not a repeating section, but the rest are.  Therefore, those buttons cannot be dragged on to the macrobar. The button rolls 1d100, without any modifiers, and then shows the skill rating listed in the from the total entry. If there roll isn't operating right, put an entry into each box; zero instead of a blank spot. The bonus gained from the the morph has already been added to the Aptitude bonus, thus is not shown. The Specialization/Other bonus entry is not added to the total, including for the button. \r*The Morph tab: This is where you add the changes Morphs apply to the aptitudes. \r*The Muse tab: Nothing of note, except there are not buttons\r*Equipment Tab: Armor, Weapon, and Gear entries are under the check boxes, so you can hid whatever it it you are not using. There is only a single weapon and armor entry; use the gear tab for secondary gear of these types\r*Story Tab: In the Rep portion, the last entry called Other is a place holder.  This can written in, representing another kind of Rep. The Recent History section is a repeating block to hold important events the player needs to keep.",
