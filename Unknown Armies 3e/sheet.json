	"instructions": "A character sheet for the Third Edition of Unknown Armies. Made based on the most official one I could find, with some alterations to make it newbie-friendly(circular buttons replacing the push-pins at the top of the Relationship sticky notes, next to Shock Gauge names, a leaflet with buttons for the skills, and a set of buttons for Identities). The area for the extra/supernatural ability/adept/avatar identity might be a little glitchy."
