The sheet autocalculates the Number ranges and rolls them properly, respecting whether a roll needs to be low or high to succeed. A siimple roll template is included. \n\n* Alternate Sheets:\n* Trollbabe is a game many people have modded over the years. This sheet lets you choose between the official Trollbabe system, Tears in the Rain (a Bladerunner hack by Per Fischer), John Harper's unfinished Stranger Things (no relation to the TV show), and a Custom Sheet that lets you tweak the attribute names and other stats.",
