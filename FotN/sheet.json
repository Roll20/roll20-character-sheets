The FotN companion script will reflect changes made to the status effects on to an appropriatly named playmat. On this sheet, the right hand check box will open up a submenu of stats and the left check box will equip the item or ability so that it's stats get added to the 'current' page. Please see the video at https://youtu.be/kabfP442mLQ for a complete demo.",
