The Other Traits were kept to increase gameplay flexibility. All rolls from the sheet are of the from {Xd10}>Df1, where X is the number of dice and D is the difficulty.  NOTE: These roll do not recognize botches or specialties. Rolls will prompt the user to modify the number of dice rolled and set the difficulty.  The defaults for these are 0 and 6 respectively.",
