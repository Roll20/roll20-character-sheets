Willpower and Faith can be directly rolled from the sheet. The Dice Pool section was kept and updated to fit Demon Attributes and Abilities from the V20 sheet. The Other Traits were kept to increase gameplay flexibility. All rolls from the sheet are of the from {Xd10}>Df1, where X is the number of dice and D is the difficulty.  NOTE: These roll do not recognize botches or specialties. Rolls will prompt the user to modify the number of dice rolled and set the difficulty.  The defaults for these are 0 and 6 respectively."
