Dark Heresy Character Sheet\rThe most important roll is the %{characteristic} roll. ([[(@{characteristic}+?{Modifier|0}-1d100)/10]] degree(s) of success!)\rIt takes the characteristic you selected in the drop down, then you may add or subtract a modifier, then it rolls 1d100 and subtracts that from your starting value. That divided by 10 is the amount of degrees of success you achieved.\r**You can emulate everything in this sheet with just this single roll if you don't want to use the rest!**\r\r [Sheet Readme](https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-character-sheets/blob/master/Rogue_Trader/readme.md)",
