Reign 1e Character Sheet

This sheet is designed for the Reign TTRPG, by Greg Stolze.

#Information

Not the highest quality sheet, but I think it will work decently enough; I'm pretty new to HTML and CSS, so some things are unfortunately just a bit out of my grasp.

While it's probably possible, accounting for expert and master dice in the actual roll itself seems really clunky; you'd need some kind of pop up every time you roll which would probably really slow things down. If you have a seven dice pool where one die is an expert dice, you would just put in chat or tell your GM what you set the expert die to and then roll six dice. In Roll20 you do this by writing "/roll Xd10mtsd", where X is the amount of dice in your pool.
