HârnMaster Gold Character Sheet
===========================

This sheet is for use with the [HârnMaster Gold](https://www.kelestia.com/harnmaster/gmedition) roleplaying game.  It includes expanded ranges for missile weapons in order to support Bill Gant's [GunMaster Gold](https://www.lythia.com/harnmaster/hm-houserules/gunmaster-gold/) house rules.

Features:
* 3 Tabs for Character, Inventory and Settings
  * Character Tab shows all information relevant during play, including an optional Horse section 
  * Inventory tab has space for weapons, inventory, money, general notes and more. Denote on any item if it's actively carried or not (stored on horse or other location for example) 
  * Settings tab provides options to show the Horse section, split out Piety tracking per god, and toggle some houserules
* Roll buttons for each skill that includes appropriate penalty (depending on optional rules).
* Development roll buttons for each skill.
* Roll buttons to do Attribute checks (with a prompt to select DM determined multiplier).
* Shock/Fumble/Stumble checks.
* Healing Rolls
* Weapon Quality Checks
* Weapon use rolls with adjustments for primary and secondary hand use.
* Separate missile weapon section with ranges (up to 1024 hexes) and their penalties & damage.
* Spell/Ritual/Psionic checks.
* EMLs for in-sheet rolls are capped at 5/95 respectively as per rules.
* Checkbox under load toggles correct Fatigue and Encumberance for Mounted players. It also updates initiative and movement for the character based on horse information from the Horse section (if enabled)
* An included horse section to facilitate HarnMaster horse combat rules where character and horse skills are averaged. (this section can be shown/hidden via the Settings tab)
* Items on the Inventory tab can be marked as "Carried", which affects the Character tab: weight will be added to load carried, armor values will be added to armor protection and weapons will show up on the Character tab.

Auto-Calculations:
* Encumbrance based on Load and Endurance or Condition / 5.
* Injury Totals
* Physical Penalty and optionally a Universal Penalty applied to non-physical skills.
* Show move, minimum move and turning hexes based on current Horse Speed.
* Armor values: add armour pieces (find values in the HMG Rulebook) in the inventory tab, fill in armor values for B/E/P/F and check locations covered. Check them as "worn/carried (C)" and total armor values are shown on the character tab.
* Easily drop weapons and reduce inventory load (and encumbrance) on the fly.
* Auto calculate initiave and effective horse riding skill automatically for the horse included in the (optional) horse section, when "Mounted" (checkbox).

Optional Rules:
* Use Condition / 5 instead of Endurance for encumbrance calculations.
* Include Encumbrance in Physical Penalty
* Apply a HM3-style Universal Penalty to non-physical skills.
