Titan World (Unofficial Attack on Titan RPG)

Titan World is based off of the Apocalypse World engine, and so after playing a couple of Titan world games
I decided to modify the existing AW sheet to fit Titan World. 

This is my first attempt at actually making something like this, so I apologise that it
isn't overly pretty, but it is clean and functional. If you have suggestions or would like
to improve on it then just drop me a PM on roll20.
