# FABDOFS Character Sheet

This is a character sheet for use on Roll20.net with the FABDOFS system, an alchemy of 2e, ACKS, BECMI, and other inspirations.  You've never seen the like!

## Features
This version of the sheet incorporates roll templates, autocalculation of AC, movement rates, WR, and most other derived values.  It does not require access to features of the Dev server or the API.
