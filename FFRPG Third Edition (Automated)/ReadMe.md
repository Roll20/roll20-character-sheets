# FFRPG Third Edition Character Sheet

This sheet was written for use with the Returner's Final Fantasy RPG Third Edition. The original version of this sheet was designed by John Myles (Actoba on Roll20.net) for DnD_5e. It has been extensively modified and will continue to be updated as necessary. This particular version is designed to automate as much of the combat calculations as possible. This will require all monsters and characters have a sheet in roll20. A non-automated version is available as well. Optional rules for Map Combat and Limit Breaks are fully supported. Sheet help is available on roll20.net from Kiyomi N. The sheet is designed to be usable by all Roll20 users regardless of subscription level.

### Changelog

* Initial release - 20th September 2016
First release of the sheet.  It should fully support the everything in the FFRPG Third Edition Core Rulebook.  Whilst the sheet cannot possibly cover every situation, and nor can it replace a basic understanding of the game rules/mechanics, it should be a helpful tool for new players whilst still providing more experienced players with some useful facilities too.

* Automated Branch release - 5th May 2017
I have made the decision to remove targeting from my FFRPG sheet. This means that all characters and monsters will no longer require a sheet in roll20, however, you will need to adjust your CoS calculations based on your target's eva/m.eva manually, as well as your damage based on arm/m.arm. I have released a seperate Automated branch which will hopefully support additional features such as automatic damage calculation in the future.

### Other resources

* Macros can be a little complex for this sheet, and token macros especially might seem daunting at first. I have sample macro templates available upon request. ((https://www.dropbox.com/s/lt3nqi1spva2bxp/Macro%20Tutorial.docx?dl=0))

### Feedback

If you have any problems, suggestions or features you'd like to see added to the sheet then please let me know either by logging an issue on the github repo or by sending me a private message via roll20. Please be patient when waiting for a reply, I will respond as quickly as possible!
