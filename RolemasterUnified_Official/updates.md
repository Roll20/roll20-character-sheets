Work continues on improving 'stuff' (aka Inventory or items).  So first up we have casting penalties
for armor calculated and working.  This may may the spell casters in your group most unhappy.  I hope
they stocked up on Transcendance.   We have also added a 'pack' and 'store'.  A pack is backpack or
similar item you can drop if in combat.   Or maybe on your horse.  There is a toggle button to carry
or not carry it.  Encumberance pnealties are calcualted depending if carried or not.   Store is for
stuff you character doesn't have with them.  Homewares or buried treaures.  You can move items between
the three lists easily.

Then there is a pile of small items; Spells persist previous ranks on levelup.  Lots of people have
asked for this - Enjoy!

- Stuff (aka Inventory)
  - Spell equipped correctly.
  - Items only count to encumberance% if equipped (w/ test)
  - Add Store & Backpack sections
  - Add toggle for backpack carried
  - Allow items to move between sections with a click
- Add support for transcendance and spell Enc% penalties
- Make bleed a local (internal change)
- Reset current round/phase on new combat.
- Show the current round in the action box
- Don't set negative PP on the character sheet (min 0)
- Spells remember how many you got on level up.

# 2024-9-26

Start work on fully supporting encumbrance and maneuver penalties.  So now we
calculate load (we did not before), our max pace (been empty forever), change
the property name to carried_weight (was set, but never used before).

- Creatures:
  - Handle more attack types
  - Creature attacks work again with the new maneuver penalties.
  - Fix issue with creatures without skills failing
- Update maxpace and load %s on sheet
  - Need to update equipment in the compendium to make this effective.
- Add a dot to show skills you have a profession bonus in
- Update DB:
  - Add passive block to active dodges and passive dodge to active block
  - Cap running ranks, not passive DB at 50.

# 2024-9-24

A number of small updates this week.  Starting some work to fix a mumber of other wierd bugs; but nothing yet.
Thank you to all who have reported problems.  Please let me know if there are more.

- Dark mode tweaks for side panel, and the crit box.  Dark mode is still a long
  way from complete on the main sheet; but the side panel should be usual.
- Spell rank modifier when casting; missed that in the other massive improvements.
- Don't barf AP updates on New Combat.
- Fix for weight allowance (thanks spaturno80).  I totally misread those rules.  Like totally.
- Creature sheet improvements for skills and other items.
- Async: Recover is a few more wierd situations (thanks major__havoc).
- Spells: Show trickery and grace bonuses in spells.  This is the sort of
  feature you get when I play with the sheet, not just GM with the sheet.

[Compendium]
Add base lists by profession to the spell law list. Treasure Law data imported
for most non-magical items.  Chapter 1 complete.  Chapter 2 is 75% complete.
Monsters for other modules are getting ready too.

# 2024-9-19

Urgent fix for a roll20 API change.  Some of the values in fields from the
charactermancer started getting expansion ids shoved on the return values.
(if they contain a ~).

- Force HP and PP to max on levelup
