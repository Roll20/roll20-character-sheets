# DnD5E Character Scrolls
A custom Roll20.net character sheet for **Dungeons & Dragons** 5th Edition.

The DnD5E Character Scrolls character sheet is designed to be flexible, memorable, and easy to use. To fulfill these goals, it features a simple two-column layout with eye-catching icons next to each section and entry. For flexibility, this character sheet takes a fill-in-the-blank approach to nearly all entries on the character sheet, reserving automatic calculation and drop-down menus for only core game mechanics that wouldn't change even in a home-brew campaign setting. D20 roll buttons are present for convenient rolling of ability checks, saves, and attack rolls. 

Using the DnD5E Character Scrolls sheet feels more like using a paper sheet and less like a character generator. If you love to customize your characters beyond the normal parameters, or your campaign features home-brew classes and other content, you will likely enjoy the simplicity and flexibility of this character sheet. However, if you are looking for a character sheet that frees you from having to keep your Player's Handbook at the ready, then this is probably not the character sheet for you.

## Features
- Distinctive yet simple art style
- Minimal auto-calculation to allow for multi-class characters and home-brew content
- Icons for each skill and section to help remember what the skills do
- Drag-and-drop support for spells from the compendium
- Drag-and-drop compedium monster entries into the pets section to fill-in the stats for pets/familiars/animal companions
