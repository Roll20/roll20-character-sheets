Updates:

2014-04-23 14:27 :
Added Attack workspace and started item management.

2014-04-16 19:26 :
Full CSS reworking, almost all styles now controlled by css file (not dependant on roll20's base css file).

-Alex L.

2014-04-12 21:25 :
As everything in the D&D 4E sheet is now pretty much in working order, a proper readme file detailing special use cases and general how-to's could be useful? Intent would be for someone with zero knowledge of code should be familiar with how to use the sheet after reading this file. -Ville S.

2014-04-09 20:23 :
Updated html and css to resemble classic B/W 4th Edition character sheet.

ToDo:
Rolls - Waiting on Rileys response re:Buttons with text.
