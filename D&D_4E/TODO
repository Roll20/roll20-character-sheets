Would a TODO file be useful for co-ordinating what everyone might be working on, or is there a better way to do it on Git?

F.ex.

General layout //Unfinished, getting to it ASAP -Ville S //Done -Alex L.

Ability Scores //Added basic scores, working on modifiers / mod + Â½ level, defenses. -Ville S //Done -Alex L.

Skills //To do, soon. -Someone else //Done -Alex L.
