# Dragonlance: 5th Age (SAGA System)
This is a simple Roll20 character sheet designed for the Dragonlance: Fifth Age SAGA System, originally released in 1996.
  * [Dragonlance: 5th Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonlance:_Fifth_Age "5th Age Wiki") - [SAGA System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAGA_System "SAGA System Wiki")

Since the SAGA System uses a "Fate Deck" in place of dice, this character sheet is very straightforward. Still, whenever possible interactive buttons and automatic functions were included, such as: 
  * Calculating Spell Points (based on Reason Ability Score)
  * Buttons to announce (and thus track) Advanced Attacks/Defense actions in Chat

The SAGA System is not without flaws. As a result, many elect to homebrew their own set of rules. This sheet aims to not encumber that. The trade-off is that you wont find much fancy sheet action either. 

## Contents
Beyond the Character Sheet, other items include: 
  * FateDeck.zip (all cards required to play the game)
  * Hexagonal world map of Krynn (5th Age)
  
*Not included: Any of the original rulebooks. Please check online.*
