			If the character is new, data_version (the attribute) is just an empty string and dataVersion (the variable declared in this function) is NaN.
			New characters do not need any migration, but sheet initialization to set up the sheet including setting data_version to the current sheet version.

			Why this is necessary
			* Sheet-defined attributes such as data_version will change automatically if they are different in a new sheet version.
			* Once a sheet-defined attribute is changed e. g. via setAttrs(), the value will not change with new sheet version.
			* If a character was not opened for a long time (before data_version was set via script), the character's data version will update when the value is changed in a new sheet
			* This would lead to no migrations being performed.
			* On the other hand data_version could be left at its initial value, but that would mean that every new character would get all migrations unnecessarily!
