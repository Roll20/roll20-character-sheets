This is a character sheet for Osprey Games' Romance of the Perilous Land, a Roleplaying Game of British Folklore by Scott Malthouse (@trollishdelver).  Romance of the Perilous Land was originally based on David Black's The Black Hack although it has evolved a fair distance from that game.

Anyone who would like to make an improvement or base their own sheet on this one is welcome to do so without my permission, although if you reach out to me on twitter (@pellamwasteland) I would love to see your work!
