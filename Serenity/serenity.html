            Life Points measure how much damage you can take before passing out
            or dying. When your character is punched, stabbed, or shot, the
            damage comes out of your total Life Points. If your damage is equal
            or greater than your Life Points, you’re out of the action.
            Calculate your total by adding the die types of your Vitality +
            Willpower Attributes. For example, a character with a d8 Vitality
            and a d6 Willpower has 14 Life Points.

              Plot Points are a way for major characters in the game to add a

              odds for important actions, prevent someone from getting killed or
              badly injured, or even used to alter the story.

                      partially or fully disabled in that sense—awfully hard to

                      hearing. Note that Skill use against other characters is
                      opposed, so some of the following examples could vary in
                      actual play. Specialties: deduction, empathy, gambling,
                      hearing, intuition, investigation, read lips, search,

                      you’re able to make the craft perform. In addition to
                      simply flying, the Skill also covers charting a course,
                      maintenance, and basic troubleshooting—though any serious
                      problem is covered by Mechanical Engineering. You need a
                      Skill roll to control the craft under adverse conditions,
                      evade pursuit, or perform difficult maneuvers. A Botch
                      roll does not mean you’ve instantly crashed your craft—but
                      it certainly means you’ve made the ride a helluva lot more
                      interesting! Specialties: aerial navigation, astrogation,
                      astronomy, astrophysics, space survival. (Note that
                      specific types of craft are also Specialties. Examples
                      include: gunships, hang gliders, helicopters, large
                      cruisers, mid-bulk transports, patrol vessels, rocket
                      shuttles, ultra-light aircraft, and short-range shuttles.)

                      Both are a whole lot quieter than a rifle and just as
                      deadly between the eyes. Specialties: blowguns, bows,

                      knowledge of everything and detailed knowledge for each
                      Specialty you take. Note that there is a difference
                      between applied knowledge and “book learning.” You can’t
                      have both. For instance, you can’t have “Gunsmithing”
                      because that’s a Specialization of Gun Combat and counts
                      as applied knowledge. (You might have once read a book on
                      guns, but that doesn’t mean you know how to manufacture a
                      gun.) Specialties: appraisal, cultures, history, law,

                      fist, but it is—on occasion—necessary. And sometimes
                      nothing brings more satisfaction to one’s soul than
                      delivering a good old-fashioned punch to the jaw. For
                      those who relish those occasions, this is the skill to
                      use, whether it’s a knee to the groin, kick to the shin,
                      hook to the chin, chop to the throat or gouge to the eye.
                      Note that while Unarmed Combat doesn’t involve the use of
                      weapons, this and the Brawling specialty can allow you to
                      use weapons of opportunity (beer bottles, etc.).
