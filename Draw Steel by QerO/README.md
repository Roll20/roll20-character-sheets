###### An advanced character sheet for Draw Steel v1.0



Includes Character, Party, and Monster modes. End only for now. Built for maximum flexibility in data entry with a clean, convenient UI/UX. Anywhere you can spend or restore resources, you’ll find dedicated controls - for example, applying damage that accounts for temporary Stamina. Wherever dice rolls are expected, there are Power Roll buttons with modifiers. Also includes an optional lightweight rule for gradual progression of Wealth and Renown.



This is the first iteration of the sheet, originally created for my own game. If there’s interest from the community - and I have the time and energy - I’ll keep improving it and add localization support.
