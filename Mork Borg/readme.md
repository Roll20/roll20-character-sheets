# _Mörk Borg_ Character Sheet

This character sheet was developed for [_Mörk Borg_](http://www.morkborg.com).

The game's official character generator, [SCVMBIRTHER](https://scvmbirther.makedatanotlore.dev/), is recommended for quick PC creation.

To the best of my knowledge/ability, the sheet is set up for internationalization/translation of all text displayed in the sheet and outputted from sheet roll buttons.
