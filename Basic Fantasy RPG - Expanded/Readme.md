**Basic Fantasy Roleplaying Game Sheet**
This is a character sheet for use on Roll20.net with the Basic Fantasy Roleplaying Game core and some optional supplements.

**Features**
This version of the sheet incorporates roll templates, autocalculation of AC, and most other derived values. It does not require access to features of the Dev server or the API. It includes support for play with most of the optional supplements. This sheet is not compatible with the original Basic Fantasy sheet due to additional fields and naming convention.

Working on autocalculation for the encumbrance (code not included in this revision due to not working).

**Credit Where Credit is Due**
The CSS and much of the layout is lifted from the work of allenmaher's BECMI sheet who lifted the excellent work of John Myles (@Actoba on roll20) and the 5e Dungeons and Dragons sheet.
