**Basic Fantasy Roleplaying Game Sheet**
This is a character sheet for use on Roll20.net with the Basic Fantasy Roleplaying Game core and some optional supplements.
**Features**
This version of the sheet incorporates roll templates, autocalculation of AC, and most other derived values. It does not require access to features of the Dev server or the API. It includes support for play with most of the optional supplements. This sheet is not compatible with the original Basic Fantasy sheet due to additional fields and naming convention.
