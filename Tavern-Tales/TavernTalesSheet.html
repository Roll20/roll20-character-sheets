		Tavern Tales Version: 
		<div class="sheet-popupHelp">
			<span>
				<p>Version 0.9, from 2014, appeared before the launch of the Kickstarter campaign. It included HP, damage dice, damage reduction. (Tactical gamers prefer this version.)</p>
				<p>Version 1.0, from 2016, introduced Challenge Tracks and removed HP and damage.</p>
				<p>Additional playtest rules introduced Resources (Health, Endurance, Willpower). They also codified how players can spend bad tales (Story gamers prefer this version.)</p>
				<p>Version 2.0 is the Community Developed version. It's currently under development, so it may be missing some important information. Refer to previous versions to fill in the gaps.</p>
				<p>For any version, if a rule isn't clear or if something feels incomplete, feel free to make your own rulings, or draw inspiration from the other versions.</p>
				<p>For more about versions, and to contribute to version 2.0-CC, check the subreddit /r/Tavern_Tales on reddit.com</p>

					<h3>Weapons</h3>
	 
					<p>In Tavern Tales, you are in complete control of your character’s aesthetics. That rule also extends to your character’s weapons. It’s entirely up to you to define what weapons your character uses, and how he uses those weapons in combat. Because of this, Tavern Tales allows you to choose your weapons’ mechanics and their aesthetics separately.
					 
					</p><p>A weapon’s aesthetics is what it looks like (your weapon is a simple longsword, a serrated axe, a glowing mace, etc). Weapon aesthetics are limitless and completely within your control.
					 
					</p><p>Weapon mechanics work a bit differently. To understand weapon mechanics in Tavern Tales, consider the following question: What does a staff do in a fantasy world?
					</p><p>To a barbarian, a staff is a blunt weapon suitable for bashing skulls.
					</p><p>To a monk, a staff is a precise weapon that requires speed and finesse.
					</p><p>To a wizard, a staff shoots fireballs and bolts of lightning.
					 
					</p><p>Clearly, weapons mean different things to different people. For that reason, it’s up to you to decide the mechanics of your weapons. When you pick up or use a weapon for the first time, you must decide on the weapon keywords for those weapons. You get 2 weapon keywords from the list below. This applies regardless of how many items you are holding. A person wielding a sword and shield, a person wielding a pair of daggers, a person wielding a single rapier, and a person wielding a two-handed great axe each get 2 weapon keywords.
					 
					</p><p>This flexibility allows players to create truly unique fighting styles. For example, a player might decide that holding a shield and no weapon grantsranged and piercing. In this case, it’s a good idea for the player to describe why holding a shield grants that fighting style. Perhaps he emits beams of holy light from his shield, or perhaps he throws his shield before having it bounce back to his hand.
					</p><p>It’s a good idea to record your decision on the character sheet. For example, suppose you decide that holding a sword grants you melee anddisarming. You sheathe your sword, and a few days later you draw it again. At that point, the sword should still grant you melee and disarming. Recording weapon keywords on your character sheets ensures that you are consistent from combat to combat.
					 
					</p><p>The most common traits are melee and ranged, but players are not obligated to select those options. A player might instead opt for leadership-based keywords (defensive and cleansing, perhaps). Also, if a trait grants a player the melee keyword with all of his weapons, then the player might opt for a more offensive combination (disarming and reach, perhaps).
					 
					</p><p>Weapon Keywords
					 
					</p><p>Melee: When you make a melee attack with a weapon that doesn’t have the melee keyword, roll -1 damage die (possibly bringing you down to 0d8+stat damage).
					 
					</p><p>Ranged: When you make a ranged attack with a weapon that doesn’t have the ranged keyword, roll -1 damage die (possibly bringing you down to 0d6+stat damage).
					 
					</p><p>Accurate: The base damage of your ranged attacks is d8 instead of d6 (does not affect melee attacks).
					 
					</p><p>Binding: Increase your rolls to maintain grapples.
					 
					</p><p>Cleansing: When you spend advantage and bolster, remove 1 debuff from yourself or a visible ally.
					 
					</p><p>Defensive: You have +2 block.
					 
					</p><p>Disarming: When you spend advantage and deal damage, disarm the target.
					 
					</p><p>Reach: Your melee attacks can reach near targets. Your ranged attacks can reach targets out to a far distance.
					 
					</p><p>Rending: When you spend advantage and deal damage, inflict bleed on the target.
					 
					</p><p>Piercing: When you spend advantage to attack, the attack ignores block.
					 
					</p><p>Staggering: When you spend advantage and deal damage, knock the target back a near distance (assuming you can logically do so).
					 
					</p><p>Here are a few examples of keyword combinations:
					</p><p>Sword and shield: Melee and defensive
					</p><p>Pair of axes: Melee and rending
					</p><p>Magic wand: Ranged and accurate
					</p><p>Sword and Pistol: Melee and ranged

					</p><p>Retraining

					</p><p>You can retrain your weapon keywords in much the same way that you retrain theme traits. If you practice weapon drills for a few hours, you can change the weapon keywords that the weapons grant you.

					</p><p>Unarmed Attacks

					</p><p>By default, your body doesn’t count as a weapon and therefore can’t gain weapon keywords. Consequently, you must roll -1 damage die when you make an unarmed attack because you don’t have the melee or ranged weapon keywords. However, players can get around this restriction. Some traits, items, and effects read:
					</p><p>Your body counts as a weapon, and your weapons have the melee keyword for free.
					</p><p>Your body counts as a weapon, and your weapons have the ranged keyword for free.
					</p><p>Your body counts as a weapon, and your weapons have the melee and ranged keywords for free.

					</p><p>If you have one of these effects, then you are able to add the default 2 weapon keywords to your body (which now counts as a weapon). For example, suppose a martial artist has “Your body counts as a weapon and gains the melee keyword for free.” He might choose to gain the bindingand defensive keywords in addition to his free melee keyword to represent his wrestling fighting style.

					</p><p>To sum up, the weapon rules are as follows:
					</p><p>If you make a melee attack without the melee keyword, or a ranged attack without the ranged keyword, you decrease the roll.
					</p><p>You can apply 2 keywords to your weapons. It doesn’t matter how many weapons you hold—you always get 2 keywords.
					</p><p>You can’t apply weapon keywords to your fists (or other natural attacks) because your body isn’t a weapon. Some traits count your body as a weapon, which allows you to overcome this restriction.
					</p><p>Many effects give you weapon keywords for free. You gain these keywords in addition to the 2 default keywords.

					</p><p>What constitutes a weapon?

					</p><p>Often, it is easy to decide what constitutes a weapon. Swords and bows are obviously weapons, but what about an enchanted holy symbol? Or what about a bar stool? Or a shield? Ultimately, it’s up to your gaming group to decide what counts as a weapon.
					</p><p>The GM should be flexible when it comes to magical items such as wands, holy symbols, totems, and spellbooks. It’s usually a good idea to define which of these items count as weapons in your campaign. For example, you might want to clarify that a book has to have magical spells written in it before it can count as a weapon. Otherwise, a wizard who gets disarmed might pick up the nearest book–a pamphlet or a diary, perhaps–and try to use it as a weapon.

					</p><p>There needs to be a distinction between weapons and non-weapons. If everything counts as a weapon, then players never have to worry about being disarmed or going into battle unarmed.

					</p><p>Keep in mind that if you count an item as a weapon, that doesn’t necessarily mean that it has to be compatible with every weapon keyword. For example, the GM might conclude that a dagger can’t have reach because daggers are so short.

					</p><p>Melee Weapon – 25 gold
					</p><p>Holding any combination of weapons grants you 2 weapon keywords.

					</p><p>Ranged Weapon – 25 gold
					</p><p>Holding any combination of weapons grants you 2 weapon keywords.

					</p><p>Ammunition Bundle – 1 gold
					</p><p>This bundle provides 10 pieces of ammunition (arrows, bullets, magic dust, etc).

					</p><p>Armor

					</p><p>Much like weapons, the type of armor that a creature wears is largely an aesthetic choice. Armor in Tavern Tales falls into one of two categories:
					</p><p>Light Armor – 20 gold
					</p><p>You have +1 block while wearing this armor.

					</p><p>Heavy Armor – 50 gold
					</p><p>You have +2 block while wearing this armor, and you decrease all rolls that relate to mobility such as climbing, swimming, sneaking, and enduring long marches.

					</p><p>It’s up to your gaming group to decide where to draw the line between light and heavy armor. Light armor typically includes leather armor, hide, and chainmail. Heavy armor typically includes scale armor and fullplate. Everyday clothing doesn’t count as armor.

					</p><p>Equipment

					</p><p>Adventurer’s Pack – 10 gold
					</p><p>An adventurer’s pack includes the following: a backpack, a bedroll, a mirror, 5 candles, flint and tinder, 50 feet of rope, a piece of chalk, and a waterskin.

					</p><p>Ammunition Bundle – 1 gold
					</p><p>This includes 10 pieces of ammunition for a specific weapon (arrows for a bow, bolts for a crossbow, crystal fragments for a wand, etc).

					</p><p>Infinite Bundle / Returning Weapon – 50 gold
					</p><p>An infinite bundle is an endless source of ammunition—a quiver that never runs out of ammunition, for example. A returning weapon is ranged weapon that returns to the user after it’s been thrown—a boomerang or a chakram, for example.

					</p><p>Healing Potion – 50 gold
					</p><p>Drink this potion (doing so is a simple action) to instantly heal an amount of life equal to your toughness. Then, you become resistant to healing potions.

					</p><p>Lockpicks – 10 gold
					</p><p>These tiny tools are necessary to pick complicated locks.

					<h3>Inventory</h3>
					<p>Creatures have 5 inventory slots. Each slot represents 1 handful of stuﬀ. Essentially, each inventory slot can hold anything that you can carry with 1 hand. Large items that require 2 hands to carry (such as a two-handed axe) take up 2 inventory slots. A handful of small items (such as rings or keys) take up 1 inventory slot.</p>
					
					<h3>Treasure</h3>
					<p>Treasure is abstract in Tavern Tales to avoid excessive bookkeeping. Your gaming group needs to work together to determine the value of 1 treasure, which can change during the game. Here are a few examples of what 1 treasure might be worth:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>To a street urchin, 1 treasure is a loaf of bread.</li>
						<li>To an adventurer, 1 treasure is a bag of coins.</li>
						<li>To a warrior-king, 1 treasure is a pile of gold.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>Players ignore all treasure gains and losses that are below 1 treasure. Tese gains and losses are considered tobe so trivial that they don’t aﬀect your fnances at all. For example, suppose your group decides that 1 treasure is worth a bag of gold coins. If you notice a gold coin on the street and pick it up, you won’t gain any treasure because it’s below your threshold. Similarly, if you spend a few coins on a mug of ale at a tavern, you won’t lose any treasure.
					</p><p>A single piece item can be worth more than 1 treasure.
					</p><p>For example, a perfect diamond might be worth 3 treasure and a golden-plated shield might be worth 5 treasure.
					</p><p>The number of slots that treasure occupies depends on its size and weight. For example, compare a perfect diamond 5 treasure with a chest full of gold coins that’s also worth 5 treasure. Te diamond would take up less than 1 slot, while the treasure chest would occupy many more slots. In fact, players may acquire so much treasure that it’s difcult to transport it all. Tere’s a good reason why dragons have to guard their gold!
					</p>
					
					<h3>Item Traits</h3>
					<p>Like theme traits, item traits are divided into combat, exploration, and interaction. Items acquire item traits the same way that players acquire theme traits. Te big diﬀerence is that you spend treasure instead of XP to buy item traits.</p>
					
					<h3>Items</h3>
					<p>To buy an item trait, spend an amount of treasure equal to that item’s new number of traits in that category. For example, giving an item its frst combat trait costs 1 treasure. Giving it a second combat trait costs 2 more treasure. Giving it a third combat trait costs 3 more treasure for a total of 6 treasure. Giving the item its frst exploration or interaction trait would only cost 1 treasure.</p>
					
					<h3>Upgrading Your Body</h3>
					<p>You can purchase item traits for your body. Tis will allow you to attack with fsts, block weapons with thick scales, or have a long rope-like tongue. Buying item traits for your body functions the same as buying item traits for items. Te only diﬀerence is that these item traits are permanent because they are now part of you.</p>
					
					<h3>Starting Equipment</h3>
					<p>
						By default, PC start the game with 2 treasure, which they can spend however they like on items. They also start with enough similar, miscellaneous items to occupy 1 inventory slot. 
						For example, here are some starting character inventories:
					</p>
					<div class="sheet-3colrow">

				<div>
					<p>In Tavern Tales, players have more control over the narrative than in traditional roleplaying games.
					Tavern Tales operates on "Tales", a type of currency spent by describing what happens in the game world. 
					When a player rolls <span name="attr_lowerLimit"></span> or higher, they get a good tale. When they roll <span name="attr_upperLimit"></span> or less, they get a bad tale.
					For rolls between <span name="attr_lowerLimit"></span> and <span name="attr_upperLimit"></span>, they get both a good and bad tale.</p>
					<p>Players can also obtain "dramatic tales" in a number of ways:
						<ul>
							<li>choosing to accept a bad tale in lieu of rolling dice</li>
							<li>choosing to forfeit their good tale in exchange for a bad tale</li>
							<li>Doing something particularly cool, inspired, or impressive</li>

					<p>When players want to accomplish something long or complex, the GM may set up a "challenge track". This is a number of checkboxes which must be completed in order to complete the challenge. Typically, a good tale will be required in order to tick a checkbox.</p>
					<h4>Delays, Detours, Shortcuts</h4>
					<p>Your challenge isn't necessarily linear. It might be a braided, multi-threaded path. There will be detours, delays, and shortcuts, all depending on your actions.</p>
					<h3>Risky, Audacious Actions</h3>
					<p>Sometimes a character will find themselves in a situation where they have a unique opportunity to shortcut the challenge. In those cases, the GM may make the roll-difficulty one step harder, in exchange for the opportunity to knock off 3 ticks on the challenge track. Sometimes you need a hail mary.</p>

				<div>
					<h3>Traits</h3>
					<p>Traits can do any of the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Grant a new ability that a human wouldn't otherwise have, tied to a dice roll.</li>
						<li>Grant a new ability that a human wouldn't otherwise have, tied to a "resource" and a dice roll</li>
						<li>Improve upon an otherwise normal human ability. These grant "bolster" to make the task easier, so your dice roll is increased.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h3>Defenses</h3>
					<p>Defenses from traits will grant an extra dice roll you can use after receiving a bad tale.</p>
					<p>Any good tale from the result will prevent the damage or effect. Any bad tale will expire this resource.</p>
					<p>As with all resources, collaborate with your group on the requirements for refreshing the resource.</p>

				<div>
					<h3>Bolstering</h3>
					<p>Characters may spend their actions assisting each other, or otherwise improving their situation. This is called a bolster action. If you get a good tale as a result of a bolster action, you may "spend" your bolster on someone to increase their roll. A roll to bolster should generally be one step easier than a roll to directly attack the same challenge.</p>

					<h4>Monster Qualities: Instincts, Attacks, and Weaknesses</h4>
					<p>
					</p><p>These three attributes describe how the monster behaves:
					</p><p> An instinct represents the monster’s objectives. Instinct answers the question, “What does the monster want to do?”
					</p><p> A trait represents what the monster is capable of doing. Traits answer the question, “How does the monster do it?”
					</p><p> A weaknesses represents the monster’s vulnerabilities. Weaknesses answer the question, “How can the players overcome it?”

					</p><p>Collectively, these 3 things are known as monster qualities.
					</p>

					<h4>Putting your own spin on monsters</h4>
					<p>
					</p><p>Monsters in Tavern Tales are somewhat vague and abstract. For example, a monster’s trait might read “Defend with magic: create walls of force, teleport to safety.” If you’re a GM who likes to think of monsters in an abstract way, then you can interpret “Defend with magic” however you like. If you’re a GM who prefers clear guidelines for your monsters, use “create walls of force, teleport to safety” as a starting point for the monster’s capabilities.
					</p><p>Don’t worry too much about balance. The difficulty keywords should give you a general idea of how to design monster traits on the fly. For example, suppose that a monster normally rolls 3 damage dice. If you decide that it should breathe cone in a fire, then you might drop it down to 2 damage dice to balance it out. Alternatively, you might want to up it to 4 or 5 damage dice to really put your players on the ropes. Keep in mind that it’s generally safer to make monsters too weak rather than too strong. This strategy will give you a chance to better understand your players’ capabilities. From there, you can gradually increase your monsters’ power to provide fitting challenges.
					</p>

					<h4>How to use Weaknesses: Make your monsters explode in a rain of gore</h4>
					<p>Monster weaknesses give you a fun, exciting way to spice up combat. Remind your players that many monsters have weaknesses, and exploiting those weaknesses can have huge rewards. As the GM, it’s up to you decide how much weaknesses hurt monsters. If a player triggers a monster’s weakness, does the player kill the monster outright? Deal extra damage? Cripple it in some way? Whatever the case, don’t be afraid to go big. For example, if a player discovers andexploits the weakness, “ Vulnerable belly,” feel free to tell the player, “Describe how you disembowel it,” or “You defeat the monster. Describe how.”
					</p>

					<h4>Monster damage</h4>
					<p>A monster might read as having “2d-4d” damage. That means that it rolls 2 to 4 dice when it deals damage (the GM decides how many). The type of die depends on the situation. Melee attacks are d8 and ranged attacks are d6.
					</p>

					<h3>Combat: Monsters</h3>
					
					<p>Monsters are combat-capable creatures that adventurers may encounter. Despite the term “monsters,” these creature’s aren’t necessarily evil or monstrous. They could become trusted allies, loyal minions, or fearless mounts. However, it’s much more likely that they will serve as deadly adversaries. Monsters are at the core of many adventures, providing the story with a suitable antagonist.</p>

					<h4>Customizing Monsters</h4>
					<p>Rather than providing detailed attributes for each monster, Tavern Tales encourages GMs to build their own monsters.</p>

					<h4>Stats</h4>
					<p>Monsters don’t roll dice, which means that they almost never use their stats. Therefore, you can ignore stats when you build your monster. Since players have to divide their XP between stats and traits, simply cut your monster’s XP in half. Spend half on traits, and ignore the other half—assume it’s being spent on stats.
					</p><p>There is one big exception. If a player acquires a monster as a minion, that player can roll on behalf of that monster. If this happens, simply spend the monster’s remaining XP on stats.</p>

					<h4>Extra Powerful Monsters</h4>
					<p>You may want to create extra powerful monsters that can deal more damage, withstand extra hits, or use special abilities. Feel free to invent traits and go with whatever seems logical. Most monsters exist to die in RPGs anyway, so don’t sweat the details. However, new GMs typically lack a deep understanding of game balance, so they should generally avoid bending the rules. Run your players through a few fghts to get a feel for their capabilities before you throw them up against extremely powerful monsters</p>

					<h3>Setting up encounters: Challenge Rating</h3>
					<p>Add up the XP for all the active characters, then create monsters with combined XP equal to 1/2 that amount.</p>
