  "instructions": "# Character Sheet\r This is a character sheet for the german rpg ABOREA. It was inspired by the Pathfinder character sheet of the roll20 community. At this time the only available language is german. \r\r##  Adjustments\r For the calculation of some values in the character sheet you need to run a specific API-script or you have to make some adjustments to get the full potential of the sheet:\r For full autocalculation you need the \"Aborea Character Sheet AutoCalculations.js\" to run (roll20 PRO user only). If you are a no PRO user at roll20 you can set the (otherwise calculated) fields manually at the last red tab in the sheet by yourself. \r\r##  Getting help\r Please read the [Aborea Character Sheet Documentation](https://wiki.roll20.net/Aborea_Character_Sheet).",
