Enter the amount of epic and blooper die seperatly when prompted and the sheet will do the work for you. \n * Ranged Attacks will show up as a fumble when you roll below the reload value, and prompt you to reload. NOTE: This means you have to check for a 1 yourself by mousing over the inline roll. \n Send your feedback to: \n * lewis.wakeford@gmail.com \n * (other contributors feel to include you details here)"
