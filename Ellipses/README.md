# Ellipses RPG Character Sheet

This is a character sheet for [Xalavier Nelson](https://twitter.com/WritNelson)'s excellent (and free) [Ellipses RPG system](https://xalaviermakeswords.itch.io/ellipses-rpg-tabletop-role-playing-system).

It comes complete with roll templates for both standard rolls, as well as sharing events from the log.

## Clearing attribute points

To remove all points from an attribute, you'll need to click just to the left of the big 0 ellipse - this was done to mimic the look of the paper sheet, where any attribute that you don't have a point in is simply not filled in, and gives you a -2 modifier to your rolls.
