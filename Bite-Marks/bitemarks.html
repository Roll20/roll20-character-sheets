          <ul>

        </div>
          <p>Any Pack member can choose to make one of these moves when the Pack is acting as a Pack. That means at least two Packmates 
          standing together and acting on the order of the Alpha and in accordance with the Traditions.</p>
        
            <p><strong>Overwhelm Them.</strong> Pay [12] Pack Pool and no matter the odds, no matter your differences, the Pack comes together and fights 
            as one. Nothing can withstand you, and this battle is yours. Everyone describes one awesome thing they did; and the Packmate who 
            chose to make this move describes the overall, glorious victory.</p>

            <p><strong>Defend Territory.</strong> Pay [8] Pack Pool. This place is yours, your sanctuary, your stronghold, your home. When the Pack defends its 
            home territory, each Packmate can improve their next roll on one of Dominate, Maul or Give in to the Wolf by one category 
            (i.e. turn a miss into a weak hit or a weak hit into a strong hit) during the scene.</p>
            
            <p><strong>In Your Nature.</strong> Pay [10] Pack Pool. You knew the enemy would make that move, and you had a contingency planned. What is it?</p>

    <h1 class="sheet-alpha">THE ALPHA
        <span>The Pack is nothing without the Alpha and the Alpha is nothing without the Pack. You are their centre, their heart and they give you status and purpose. How do you dominate your Pack? Do you rule with fear, viciously punishing the disobedient? Or are you respected and loved by all? Maybe it is just complicated. Are the Pack waiting to depose you or run into danger and die for you? There are many ways to be Alpha and the Pack always reflects your inner self.</span>
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sheet-cub">THE CUB
        <span>You are the newest member of the Pack, a freshly bitten werewolf with only a few Changes to your name. You are learning the rules and making relationships with your new Packmates but you are fucking up a lot. They love you anyway. You’re the younger sibling, indulged and frustrating. Are you desperate to prove yourself, enjoying being the baby of the family or both?</span>
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sheet-enforcer">THE ENFORCER
        <span>Every Pack has someone willing to cross a line to protect their family, to do what is necessary to ensure their survival. Someone the Alpha can use as the ultimate threat. That is you. Your loyalty to Pack and Alpha is strong and unshakeable but do you embrace your role, or carry it as a burden for those you love? Do you have any limits when pushed to the brink and what do your nearest and dearest think when you go beyond the line?</span>
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sheet-fixer">THE FIXER
        <span>Well, someone has to deal with the mortal world: luckily, you just love it. The Pack is your home and your family, but mortals hold a fascination for you, and you know their world just as well as your own. You love the way they smell, feel, and taste; and they love you back. Which is handy when the Pack needs money, information, or something disappearing. But, you exist between two worlds, more so than anyone else: and it pulls you apart.</span>
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sheet-greypelt">THE GREYPELT
        <span>The oldest and wisest among us. The Greypelt remembers the earliest days of the Pack, the battles and rivalries of the long past, the wolves who died before we came to this life of teeth and rending. The Greypelt is an esteemed elder, a former Alpha, Mother and Father to us all.</span>
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sheet-howl">THE HOWL
        <span>The Alpha may lead the Pack in this life but you shepherd them in spirit. The Pack respect you, they need your guidance just as much as the Alpha’s but in a different way. You can be the Alpha’s best friend and ally or you can be biding your time to rid the Pack of an Alpha who threatens you all to damnation. Or worse... you can be both.</span>
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sheet-prodigal">THE PRODIGAL
        <span>You used to be in the Pack and you left. Circumstance has reluctantly pulled you back – you’re here and you’re committed for now. But it is hard finding your place again. Some have welcomed you back with an embrace, some resent you and one in particular you are probably avoiding.</span>

           </h3>
            <p>When you order someone (or several people) to do something they object to doing, roll to Dominate. 
            You can make this move against NPCs and PCs alike, but against not the Pack Alpha or anyone with a Move 
            who prevents them being dominated. [NB: If you seek (consciously or unconsciously, permanently or temporarily) 
            to take control of the Pack and you do not have the Alpha playbook then you make the move “Make a Challenge” instead.] 
            For more information on how Dominate and Disobey work together please see page 112.</p>
            
            <p><strong>10+</strong> You take full control of the situation. NPCs will do as they are told even if it becomes dangerous
            or they have been away from you for a long period of time. PCs cannot Disobey your current order, but forcing them to do it 
            comes at a cost. They will take a +1 Tie on you; because some decisions come back to Bite.</p>
            
             <p><strong>7-9</strong> The situation is mostly under your control. NPCs will do as you ask but half-heartedly and may abandon an order if it becomes dangerous / they have been away from you for too long. Packmates get a –1 Forward to Disobey your current order, if they wish to attempt it. Packmates who don’t attempt to Disobey can fill in a circle on the Wolf/Human track as appropriate.</p>
             
             <p><strong>0-6</strong> Things are sliding further out of your control. If what you sought control over was a Packmate, then they describe the consequences and additionally the Packmate gets a +1 Tie on you. If it was not a Packmate then the MC makes a hard move.</p>
            
             <p>For matters of suicide and sexual consent Dominate will not work.</p>

            If the losing Alpha is a player then they can choose to retain their character and have them take a new Skin, or retire the 
            character and choose a new character with a new Skin. If the losing Alpha keeps their character they may keep their Stats but 
            discard all their Alpha moves and choose the same number of new Moves from the new Skin. If they choose a completely new 
            character then they may choose new Stats and the same number of new Moves they had previously accumulated on the Alpha Skin. 
            They must also answer the new Packmate question on the sheet.</p>

             <p><strong>0-6</strong> MC Takes over your character for the next scene. You are no longer in control of yourself – the wolf 
             takes over.</p>
            
            <p>Regardless of the result, when you return from Wolf Form, as usual, you heal 3 Harm.<br />
            
            When in Wolf Form your ability to communicate is limited to what can be
reasonably be conveyed using the mouth and body of a wolf.<br />

            When characters Give in to the Wolf, they are deliberately running the risk of their human intelligence losing control of their 
            body for the scene. If the risk pays off they will get lots of mechanical benefits  and become even more powerful. <br />

            You can take the form of a wolf at any time without affecting your stats or your health. If you want to get mechanical benefits 
            from changing to Wolf Form (in addition to the healing benefit when changing forms on page 59) then you must either Harness the Wolf 
            (see below) or Give in to the Wolf.</p>

            to find something, someone or find out information. Roll +Feral. On a hit you ask the MC questions at any time during this scene.

           <h3>SPILL</h3>
            <p>Werewolves’ feelings and emotions are much closer to the surface than humans, and the close nature of the Pack means that you express them more readily.
            <br />When you openly and truthfully express one of the following:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>your desire for a Packmate</li>
                <li>why you are hurting</li>
                <li>what you are angry about</li>
                <li>what you are afraid of</li>
            </ul>
            
             <p>add +1 Pack Pool, and give your Packmate +1 Tie on you – as they've seen you raw and vulnerable.</p>
             
             <p>This move can be used on NPC Packmates – in which case do not give them a Tie.</p>
