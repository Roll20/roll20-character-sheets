  "instructions": "This sheet is multipurpose, fulfilling  the needs for player and non-player characters, as well as for city-building. For a journal entry used in city-building, only the tabs \"City\", \"Locations\", and \"Faces\" need to be used. Fully-realized characters such as PCs will need the \"Character\" page, and the \"Worksheet\" page is provided to assist in character creation.\n\nInput fields which are not within repeating sections will display the attribute as a tooltip when hovering your mouse over them. For example, hovering your mouse over the Player box will display `@{player}`. This is also true of the six roll buttons on the character sheet, which will display the ability you have access to (eg, `%{superb}`). Not shown on the sheet, but available for use in macros, are the abilities `%{poor}` and `%{terrible}`.\n\nAttributes located within repeating sections do not have tooltips, because accessing them from macros is not officially supported by the system at this time.",
