I figured 15 marks or 3d12 would be high enough. All skills in the book are listed, with a block of five more blank skills at the bottom.  The buttons roll all dice and keep the highest one\r\r## Gifts\r* There is arepeating field at the bottom if you run out of space.\r\r## Battle\r* There is an initiative button. \r* To the attack and defence, add the dice in the appropriate columns, using the d4, d6, and so on format.  Separate each die by a comma so they are not added together.  Again, the buttons keep the highest one. \r\r## Special Thanks\r\r* Boomer, who asked for this sheet and helped with its creation.",
