This sheet for Blades in the Dark is designed to look similar to the paper sheets, and includes a sheet for both characters and the crew, as well as a faction status tracker.\n\nThis is an official sheet created by Tim Denee and Jakob Oesinghaus, and currently maintained by Evil Hat as of version 3.10. If you run into any issues with this sheet, have suggestions, or anything else, please reach out to Evil Hat at feedback@evilhat.com. We'd be happy to help.\n\nIf you're a sheet developer and looking to make changes to this sheet's code: please don't. We maintain an external copy as the authoritative source; problems that emerge with the sheet are our customer service problem, not yours. Changes you make are likely to be erased. So talk to us before making changes.\n\nKorean translation by ClockworkOwl. French translation by S. Ziterman.",
