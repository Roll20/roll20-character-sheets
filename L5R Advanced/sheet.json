  "instructions": "This is the Advanced version of the Legend of the Five Rings - (4th Edition) character sheet. The game creator **must** be a Pro Account to be able to use this sheet, because it requires the [PowerCards](https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/4285059/script-powercards-3-thread-4/?pagenum=1) and [AlterBars](https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/4741812/alterbars-2-dot-0-new-and-improved/?pagenum=1) API Scripts written by Sky Captain 13. You can find their github repository link in the forum pages above. Itâs thanks to the help of people there that this sheet is possible, so I also want to give a shout-out to them. In addition you can also install the Roll20 Audio Master API Script written by Scott C. to use the attack sound function. You can find it in Roll20 API Script Library. Instruction on how to set up the Audio API can be found here. My Discord is James S.#4239 if anybody have any questions or problems. Any improvement to the character sheet is greatly appreciated.",
