This is an Advanced character sheet for the Legend of the Five Rings - (4th Edition) role-playing game. It differs greatly from the standard character sheet available and utilizes API scripts to accurately (and correctly) calculate Target Numbers that take Raises and Wound modifier into account. The attacks check the target's Armor TN automatically, and Damages automatically reduce by the Armor Reduction. It also check to see whether you have succeed or failed.

Note: The following API Scripts must be utilized in your API console for this sheet to work properly;
	- [PowerCards](https://gist.github.com/Sky-Captain-13/452330a3d926b32da49c) by Sky Captain 13
	- [AlterBars](https://gist.github.com/Sky-Captain-13/a503c35914644e6f885f170eaeedc705) by Sky Captain 13
	- [Roll20 Audio Master](https://github.com/Kurohyou/roll20-api-scripts/tree/master/Roll20-Audio-Master) by Scott C.
  Setting up the Roll20 Audio Master API script is very simple. You just add a track for melee attacks track in the Jukebox then change its name to "Sword", then a track for ranged attacks and change its name to "Arrow", and you're done. The sound will play everytime you click to roll to hit.

My Discord is James S.#4239 if anybody have any questions or problems. Any improvement to the character sheet is greatly appreciated.
