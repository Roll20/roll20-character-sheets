# Open Legend Minimalist
Developed by Déja Augustine (a.k.a. [Kertész](https://app.roll20.net/users/1068768/kertesz) and [@dejaaugustine](https://twitter.com/dejaaugustine))

This character sheet is intended for use with the [Open Legend](http://www.openlegendrpg.com) system. In keeping with the spirit of Open Legend, the sheet does not enforce any rules (that's for your GM to do or not do at their discretion).

## Known Issues
* Physical dice prompts for attributes with a zero score show an extraneous "+" in them
* Advantage 13+ and Disadvantage 13+ are not supported
* Hitpoints, Legend Points, Speed, and Wealth are not formatted correctly on iPad

## Key Features
* Advantage / Disadvantage is tracked separately for each attribute or action, and the interface appears any time you hover over a roll button.
* When rolling to invoke a boon, the roll template will display the range of power levels that your roll would enable you to invoke.
* Players can switch between using Roll20's built-in dice engine or prompts to enter the total rolled on physical dice. Both options are equally compatible with all features and templates.

## Revision History

January 29, 2018 - The notes in the Actions section are now added to the roll and text areas are now resizable. (Thanks to Great Moustache for helping with the code for the scrolling notes)

January 22, 2018 - Changed the style of the Advantage menu to allow up to 12 Advantage and Disadvantage. Also fixed a small bug where the Power Level for Boons in the Actions section did not update correctly.
