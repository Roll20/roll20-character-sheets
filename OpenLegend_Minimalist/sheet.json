Features include:\n* Single page design (no tabs)\n* No hidden options or settings (almost)\n* Toggle between Roll20's virtual dice and prompts if you'd rather roll your own (the ONLY hidden option, click the gear beneath the logo).\n* All features (advantage/disadvantage, power level calculation, etc.) are fully compatible with both virtual and physical dice\n* Hover over any roll button to reveal per-attribute/per-action advantage/disadvantage\n* Autocalculate fields with reasonable defaults\n* Change any autocalculated field if you don't like the result (no fields are locked/disabled)\n* Room for all your actions, feats, perks, flaws, and inventory\n* Roll templates for boons show what power levels you can invoke based on your roll",
