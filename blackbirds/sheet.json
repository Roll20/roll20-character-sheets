This sheet supports all features of the core rules of Blackbirds.\r\n\r\n## Settings Page\r\nThe settings page provides a location to control how each sheet functions.\r\n\r\n- Sheet Type: This select controls what type of sheet the character acts as.\r\n  - PC sheets will have Core attributes, Combat, advances, and Theurgy (if the character has access to theurgy).\r\n  - NPC sheets will display a condensed view that can be opened in edit mode to create NPCs or a view mode to run them in game.\r\n  - A Flock sheet is used for tracking party resources like Patronage, Odic Dice, and Fortune/Misfortune. If a flock sheet is used, any PC character sheet that is set to use that flock sheet will automatically update Odic Dice, Fortune, and Misfortune to match the flock's and will stay in sync as changes are made across the flock.\r\n- Has Theurgy: This checkbox sets the PC sheet to show the theurgy tab. It has no effect in any other sheet mode.\r\n- Whisper Rolls: Sets whether the sheet should whisper rolls to the GM or not, defaults to \"No\".\r\n- Flock Sheet: This sets what the name of the flock sheet used for tracking party resources is. It Defaults to \"My Flock\", but can be changed on a per sheet basis or set to a default from the game settings screen (See option below). Note that the name used here must be the name of the character sheet used as the flock sheet."
