  "instructions": "This is the Official character sheet for the 'Free Spacer RPG' by 'Random Alien Games', version 3.2. The sheet has been redesigned to look like the paper version plus various colour components. The sheet has player tabs and Gamemaster tabs. For version 2.8 I added Salvo Mode to the crewmember sheet and for version 3 I added it to the Contingency type Corvette tab. \n\n* The Crewmember tab is for each individual Player Character.\n* The Salvo Mode a dice roll overlay on the Crewmember Log allows you to choose a skill, specialty, and tool from the sheet. When choosing Tool mods the sheet tracks your spent charge and allows you to add advantage and enter the Threat your Gamemaster provides before clicking a roll button. Finally, click the 'Spend Charge and Close' button to close Salvo Mode and spend the tracked charge.\n* As of version 3.2, Salvo Mode of take into account the crewmember or operators damaged Integrity Condition Slot. Feedback shows '/2' throughout the Salvo Mode and on the RollTemplate.\n* When rolling from Salvo Mode on the Crewmember Log the Roll Template lists it as an Away Salvo that shows your skill, specialty, and tool choices. Plus, the Charge spent, Advantage added, and Threat opposed. Finally, it shows the value of each die rolled, the result, and most likely outcome. All in Orange, grey, and black similar to the tables in the PDF.\n* The Contingency type Corvette tab is a shared sheet for the group ship.\n* Thanks to AJ, the 'Ship Configuration' widget on the Corvette tab is dynamic allowing you to create rectangles to represent each ship component in the appropriate sections, just like the paper sheet.\n* The Contingency type Corvette tab has a sheetworker that totals all repeating Assets & Trade Goods plus Complex Material and Supply resource tonnages to accurately track your ship's capacity. The total will turn red if it is greater then the total Cargo capacity listed in amenities.\n* The Salvo Mode a dice roll overlay on the Contingency type Corvette Log lets you choose the operator, which lists any Crewmember logs that have been opened this session and have a Player name listed. If your Crewmember doesnt appear ensure it has a Player name and has been opened.\n * Salvo Mode on the Contingency type Corvette sheet allows you to select a skill and specialty from pull down lists which grab ratings from your Crewmember logs. It allows you to choose a Ship System, the Launcher module, or the Launch Bay from the sheet.\n * Like the Crewmember Salvo Mode, choosing Tool mods on the Contingency type Corvette sheet tracks your spent charge. The Launcher will also track the supply you spend. On top of this, the Launch Bay module allows you to operate your shuttle craft, equip trailers, and print new trailers. It also tracks the charge spent to the tug reactor and the supply spent to print trailers. It of course allows you to add advantage and enter the Threat your Gamemaster provides before clicking a roll button just like on the Crewmember sheet. Likewise you must click the 'Spend Charge and Close' button to close Salvo Mode and spend the tracked ship or tug charge and any supply.\n* When rolling from Salvo Mode on the Contingency type Corvette tab the Roll Template lists it as a Ship Salvo or Shuttle Salvo that shows your skill, specialty, and tool choices. Plus, the Charge spent, the Supply spent, Advantage added, and Threat opposed. Finally, it shows the value of each die rolled, the result, and most likely outcome. All in Orange, grey, and black similar to the tables in the PDF.\n* Both the Crewmember and Contingency type Corvette tabs have sheetworkers that control overcharge for the reactors. If you add overcharge when the charge is under capacity, it increments by one instead and If you add 1 to charge when it is at capacity, it adds Overcharge instead.\n* The Gamemaster tabs are NPC sheets for Gamemaster use.\n* The first Gamemaster sheet is the Sophont Log, which the Gamemaster uses to track individual significant people of any species.\n* The Composite Sophont sheet is used by the Gamemaster to track multiple less significant and similar people.\n* The Swarm tab tracks swarms of tiny creatures that only become a threat together.\n* The Creature tab tracks multiple similar creatures.\n* The Behemoth Log tracks massive monsters composed of up to six discrete sections.\n* The Drone tab track groups of drones.\n* The Shuttle Log tracks an individual shuttle at away-scale or squadrons of shuttles at space-scale. The upper conditions are for the squadrons, while the lower ones are for each section of one shuttle at away-scale. All tags and aspects are used for both individual shuttles and squadrons of similar ones.\n* The Small Craft Log tracks multiple Small Craft for space scale play.\n* The Ship Log track vessels with multiple sessions comparable to the crew's Ship.\n* The Capital Ship Log tracks massive capital ships, but doesn't include a map widget; instead create maps on a page. \n\n [Free Spacer Homepage](http://www.freespacer.com/) - [Sheet Wiki Page](https://wiki.roll20.net/Free_Spacer)",
