  "instructions": "This sheet is for use with the GammaWorld 3rd edition rules. Character abilities must be rolled randomly, this is currently a requirement on the sheet -Â you cannot edit your attributes directly. To roll your character's abilities, click on the `Roll-up` tab, here you can roll attributes and hitpoints. If you wish to re-roll you need to first click `Reset`. Note that this is a slight departure from the original character sheets included with the rules in that it splits defence ratings across `energy`, `physical` and `mental`. These were implied in the rules but not fully represented on the PnP character sheet. These are calculated values based on Gear, Armour and Mutation entries.
