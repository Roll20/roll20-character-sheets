This is currently a requirement on the sheet -Â you can't edit your attributes directly. To roll your character's abilities, click on the `Roll-up` tab, here you can roll attributes and hitpoints. If you wish to re-roll you need to first click `Reset`./r/r- Adv. - This represents your character's advancement through XP. If you take your ability scores up with XP add the amount in this field./r- Tmp. - Any temporary modifiers to an ability score should be entered in this field/r- Mod. - The ability modifier is calculated automatically/r/r### Combat Stats/r/r#### Defence/r/rNote that this is a slight departure from the original character sheets included with the rules in that it splits defence ratings across `energy`, `physical` and `mental`. These were implied in the rules but not fully represented on the PnP character sheet. These are calculated values based on Gear, Armour and Mutation entries./r/r- _CS_: Column Shift/r- _RF_: Result Factor/r- _DR_: Damage Reduction",
