# Magic World

Based on the character sheet provided in the Magic World rulebook. Skill Category Bonuses, Default skill percentages, Damage Bonus, and Characteristic rolls are automatically calculated. Automatically calculates skill rolls including the category bonus and success levels, when the roll button associated with a skill is clicked. You only need to add any contextual modifiers when the roll is triggered. For weapons skills, you will need to enter the base percentage for the weapon class into the base field for that weapon. Weapon skill rolls automatically roll damage including DB. For DB and weapon damage fields enter the dice code (1d4+1 etc.).
