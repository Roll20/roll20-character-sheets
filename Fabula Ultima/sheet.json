Inputs for new Fabula Ultima content were also added (such as Zero Power and Quirks from Atlas High Fantasy), as well as some missing inputs for original mechanics. Old components were improved and/or fixed. A lot of \"spot\" buttons were added, new rolltemplates were created and the layout for rolltemplates were improved as well.",
