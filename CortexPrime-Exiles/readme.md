Exiles - Character Sheet - Cortex Prime

##Set up

- Open the Journal tab, and add a new Character.
- Click on save changes.
- Now switch to the Character Sheet tab.
- There is a green Edit button to make changes to the sheet.
- Click the Edit button again to hide the editor.

##Dice Pool Builder

The inbuilt Dice Pool Builder pulls from the character's attributes, rolls and displays the dice used and what they rolled. Hitches show up with black icons.

*NOTE* This dice roller does not support the 3D dice feature in Roll20. - Also it won't work with the Beta Mobile App.

Any feedback, or requests - I'm happy to hear.
