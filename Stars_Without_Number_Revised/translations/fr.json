If not piloted by the telekinetic, the target remains motionless or continues on its current direction of travel. If the telekinetic spends a Main Action to control them, they can be made to perform any physical action that is not directly suicidal, using the psychic’s skill levels and hit bonus for any attacks or skill checks they might make. The puppetry lasts until the end of the scene, until the target leaves the psychic’s sight, or until a sapient target believes that their action or inaction is about to get them killed.

The library is vast and contains “generic” examples of numerous human-sized objects and people, but mimicking a specific other person requires at least five minutes of close examination. The holograms projected by the emitters are good, but imperfect; anyone who closely examines the user will be able to tell that something is artificial about their appearance, and touch instantly confirms any suspicions.

The psychic cannot teleport a target to any location they could not teleport to, including locations of imminent environmental danger, such as high in the air, into a windowless tomb, or into the middle of a sea. A conscious, resisting target can make a Mental saving throw to forcibly abort the teleportation, rolling at a penalty equal to the psychic’s Teleportation skill.

Chaque utilisation de la technique Oracle nécessite une Action principale et que l'utilisateur dépense de l'effort pour la journée. Une fois déclenché, l'adepte a une vision brève et unique liée à la question sur l'avenir qu'il se pose. Cette vision provient toujours de son propre point de vue et ne révèle jamais plus d'une minute de perspicacité, bien que le psychique la traite presque instantanément dans le cadre de l'utilisation du pouvoir. \nLe MJ devrait répondre à la question comme si le PC était sur le point d'exécuter l'action ou s'engager dans la recherche d'informations pertinente à la question. Ainsi, si l'adepte voulait savoir ce que ferait le fait d'appuyer sur un bouton et que le MJ sait qu'il est connecté à une bombe, le médium pourrait avoir une vision de mort subite. Si la bombe avait un retard qui dépassait l'horizon temporel de l'oracle, cependant, le psychique pourrait simplement voir une vision de lui-même attendant patiemment, sans que rien ne se passe.\nLes visions doivent porter sur des actions et des événements, pas sur des faits abstraits. Oracle ne permettrait pas à un psychique de savoir qui est le chef du crime d'un quartier de bidonvilles, par exemple, mais cela pourrait donner une vision du psychique pris dans la prochaine émeute sanglante et du chef de gang qui dirige la myriade de voyous. Il ne pouvait pas révéler le nom d'un garde de sécurité, mais cela pourrait montrer au voyant le moment imminent où la prochaine patrouille de garde entrera dans la zone que le psychique prévoit d'infiltrer. Seules les informations les plus importantes ou les plus significatives sont véhiculées par la technique, même si plusieurs événements intéressants peuvent se produire au cours de l’horizon temporel.\nOracle ne peut être utilisé qu'une seule fois sur une question ou un sujet donné jusqu'à ce que la situation change substantiellement ou qu'une semaine s'écoule. L'horizon temporel maximal de l'Oracle augmente à mesure que la compétence de prémonition de l'adepte s'améliore.\nNiveau-0: Une minute dans le futur.\nNiveau-1: Un jour dans le futur.\nNiveau-2: Une semaine dans le futur.\nNiveau-3: Trois mois dans le futur.\nNiveau-4: Un an dans le futur.",

A teleporter can leave any clothing, shackles, adhesions, or other matter behind when he teleports, but he cannot leave behind matter that has been inserted into his body, such as cybernetics or shrapnel.

Enemies who hold their action this way waste it entirely if the psychic does not give them a chance to attack or otherwise interfere.

Opening a contact requires the telepath to Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action, and the contact lasts for a scene at most unless augmented by other techniques.\nThe depth of contact that can be made depends on the psychic’s Telepathy skill. A single contact can use any or all of the effects permitted to a telepath of the user’s skill level. Basic forms of contact do not allow for a saving throw, though more advanced probes allow the target to make a Mental saving throw to resist. On a successful save, no form of this technique that allows a save can be used on them for the rest of the scene. Level-0: Observe emotional states in a target. Intense\nemotions provide a single word or image related to the focus of the feelings.\nLevel-1: A shallow gestalt with the target’s language centers allows the telepath to understand any form of communication made by the target. If the psychic has the requisite body parts to speak the target’s language, they can communicate with it in turn.\nLevel-2: The psychic’s awareness of the target’s surface cognition is sophisticated enough to read their current thoughts, though it can’t pick up memories or non-obvious connections. The target gets a Mental saving throw to resist this.\nLevel-3: The psychic can drill down into the target’s memory to get a one or two-sentence answer to any single question they ask, or receive a single answering vision of the target’s recollections. The target can attempt a Mental saving throw to resist this power, and whether or not it succeeds the contact is automatically ended. It can be re-established, but only by activating this technique again.\nLevel-4: The psychic instantly gets a full and nuanced awareness of everything the target can remember about a particular topic.

The cancer can be treated by a TL4 hospital or ship’s sick bay if managed within a month’s time. If the biopsion Commits Effort for the day instead of the scene, they can control the power sufficiently to do no hit point damage and create very subtle tumors, leaving the cancer undetectable without a TL4 medical examination.

Dans le cadre d'une vie sur la route, il a maîtrisé un certain nombre d'astuces pour assurer sa mobilité et survivre aux inévitables difficultés d'une existence vagabonde.\nNiveau 1: Gagnez Survivre en compétence bonus. Vous pouvez transmettre des idées de base dans toutes les langues communes du secteur. Vous pouvez toujours trouver un transport gratuit vers une destination souhaitée pour vous-même et un petit groupe de vos amis à condition que tout trafic se rende à l'endroit. Trouver ce moyen de transport ne prend pas plus d'une heure, mais il peut ne pas être un moyen de transport strictement légitime et peut nécessiter un droit de passage.\nNiveau 2: Vous pouvez falsifier, récupérer ou mettre la main sur des papiers de voyage et des pièces d'identité pour l'équipe avec 1d6 heures de travail. Ces papiers et permis résisteront à un examen ordinaire, mais nécessiteront une vérification opposée Int / Administrer contre Sag / Percevoir s'ils sont examinés par un fonctionnaire alors que le PC est en fait recherché par l'État pour un crime.

	"WARPAINT": "Warpaint",
	"WARPAINT_DESC": "Warpaint is the common term for the bizarre combat fashions and scrap-built street harness of gangers, cult enforcers, street toughs, and other marginal sorts with little money but much need for protection. Most warpaint is fashioned of scrounged scraps of TL4 materials that are exceptionally tough or rigid, filled out with gang colors, body paint, intimidating tattoos, and the usual threatening grimace. It is often exceedingly impractical but inspirational to its wearer; an NPC in warpaint that is meaningful to them gains a +1 Morale bonus. Most warpaint is either pieced together over years or taken from the dead. Actually purchasing a finished suit comes at the listed price, assuming someone can be found willing to part with theirs.",
	"WARRIOR": "Guerrier",
	"WARRIOR_CLASS_ABILITY": "Vous gagnez un niveau dans un focus martial lié à votre expérience. Le MJ décide si un focus est qualifié s'il s'agit d'un cas ambigu. \n- Les guerriers ont de la chance au combat. Une fois par scène, en tant que capacité instantanée, vous pouvez choisir d'annuler un jet d'attaque réussi contre vous ou de transformer un jet d'attaque manqué que vous avez effectué en un coup réussi. Vous pouvez utiliser cette capacité une fois les dés lancés, mais elle ne peut pas être utilisée contre les dégâts environnementaux, les effets sans jet d’attaque ou les coups sur un véhicule que vous occupez. \n- Vous gagnez deux points de vie maximum supplémentaires à chaque niveau de personnage.",

When triggered, a belt of explosives fires off a scything blast of shrapnel on any side of the vehicle. All creatures within 10 meters of that side of the vehicle must make an Evasion save for half damage. Those within 20 meters take half damage, and can make an Evasion save to take none at all. Wheatcutter belts do not ignore a vehicle’s Armor like other Heavy weapons do. Reloading a wheatcutter belt costs 200 credits per round.",

	"WIDEAWAKE_SERUM_DESC": "Originally designed to facilitate spike drills for single-man ships that couldn’t afford a sleeping pilot, wideawake serum gives the user enormous vigor and alertness for up to seven days at a time. The user need not sleep or even rest, but during this time it is impossible to recover accrued System Strain. A successful Heal check at difficulty 10, made at most once per day, can flush the drug from the user prematurely.",
	"WILD_PSYCHIC_TALENT": "Talent Psychique Primitif",
	"WILD_PSYCHIC_TALENT_DESC": "Certains hommes et femmes naissent avec une forme très limitée de MES, la condition mentale qui permet l'utilisation de pouvoirs psychiques. Bien que ces personnes ne soient pas de véritables psychiques, ces «talents primitifs» peuvent créer un effet psychique limité. L'entraînement n'est pas toujours nécessaire pour développer cette capacité, et leur MES est si doux qu'ils ne subissent pas le risque de folie ou de lésions cérébrales que les psychiques plus développés risquent s'ils utilisent leurs pouvoirs sans entraînement approprié. \nCeux ayant un talent primitif ne sont pas traités comme psychiques et ne peuvent pas «torch» leurs pouvoirs. Le cas échéant, ils sont traités comme ayant un point d'effort. Les psychiques et les psychiques partiels ne peuvent pas prendre ce focus. \nNiveau 1: Choisissez une discipline psychique. Vous gagnez une capacité équivalente à la puissance de base de niveau 0 de cette discipline. Vous pouvez éventuellement choisir une technique de niveau 1 dans cette discipline, mais cette technique doit être autonome; vous ne pouvez pas en choisir une qui augmente une autre technique ou capacité de base. Par exemple, vous pouvez choisir la technique de l'armurerie télékinésique de Télékinésie, car cette capacité ne nécessite l'utilisation d'aucun autre pouvoir de télékinésie. Vous ne pouvez pas choisir la capacité Mastered Succor de Biopsioniques, car cette technique est destinée à augmenter un autre pouvoir que vous n’avez pas.\nNiveau 2: Vous avez maintenant un effort maximum de deux points. Vous pouvez choisir une deuxième capacité selon les directives ci-dessus. Cette seconde n'a pas besoin d'être une technique autonome si elle augmente la puissance que vous avez choisie pour le niveau 1 de ce focus. Ainsi, si votre premier choix gagnait la puissance de niveau 0 de Psychic Succor, votre second pourrait être Mastered Succor. Cependant, vous ne pouvez toujours pas obtenir la puissance de base de niveau 1 de Psychic Succor, car vous êtes toujours limité au niveau 0.",
