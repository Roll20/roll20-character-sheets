If the telekinetic spends a Main Action to control them, they can be made to perform any physical action that is not directly suicidal, using the psychic’s skill levels and hit bonus for any attacks or skill checks they might make. The puppetry lasts until the end of the scene, until the target leaves the psychic’s sight, or until a sapient target believes that their action or inaction is about to get them killed.

The trigger can be any perceptible stimulus: a particular time, the sight of a specific person, a code phrase, or any other sign, and it may be changed by the user each time they activate the cyberware.

The dust then lays down a trail behind the tagged object, one that is visible to the user or to someone using a properly-keyed tracer.

A telekinetic user pushes a resistance bar within the generator, causing a flow of electricity to recharge an attached power cell. Any telekinetic with Telekinesis-1 skill or better can recharge a cell with fifteen minutes of concentration. In an emergency, a character with at least Strength 10 can operate the generator manually, though they need to succeed on a difficulty 8 Con/Exert skill check in order to keep up the pace for an hour.

This force isn’t responsive enough to be effective as a weapon without further refinement of technique, and cannot cause damage to living or mobile targets. If used to crush or harm immobile unliving objects, it does 1d6 damage per skill level of the psychic per round of focus. Objects move at 20 meters per round when moved telekinetically.\nA telekinetic force can be maintained over multiple rounds without expending further actions, such as holding a metal platform in place under a group of allies, but the psychic cannot again activate this technique on a second object until they release the first.\nLevel-0: The psychic can exert force as if with one hand and their own strength.\nLevel-1: The psychic can manipulate objects as if with both hands and can lift up to two hundred kilograms with this ability.\nLevel-2: The psychic can lift or manipulate up to four hundred kilograms and smash a human-sized hole in structures of light wooden construction or lighter as a Main Action.\nLevel-3: The psychic can manipulate up to eight hundred kilograms and can affect as many individual objects at once as they have Telekinesis skill levels.\nLevel-4: The psychic can manipulate up to a metric ton and can smash human-sized holes in TL4-constructed exterior walls, light stone walls, or similar barriers as a Main Action.",

This burst requires some time to detonate, however, and will only go off at the end of the next round. Targets of this technique are aware of an oppressive, electrical tingling in the air and are apt to instinctively move; this technique is thus generally useless against any target that is not entirely immobile, as any movement of a chosen target disrupts the ram. Once the ram detonates, however, it is sufficient to destroy any immobile civilian vehicle, create a five-meter hole in anything short of hardened military fortifications, or inflict 5d12 damage on anything else as if it were struck by a Heavy weapon.",

This assault cannot kill a target, but can knock them unconscious for an hour if they’re reduced to zero hit points, after which they wake up with one hit point.

	"TELEPATHIC_CONTACT": "Telepathic Contact",
	"TELEPATHIC_CONTACT_DESC": "The telepath can obtain a progressively-deeper understanding of a sentient target’s thoughts. The target must be visible or otherwise perceptible to the telepath’s unaided senses. Opening a contact requires the telepath to Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action, and the contact lasts for a scene at most unless augmented by other techniques.\nThe depth of contact that can be made depends on the psychic’s Telepathy skill. A single contact can use any or all of the effects permitted to a telepath of the user’s skill level. Basic forms of contact do not allow for a saving throw, though more advanced probes allow the target to make a Mental saving throw to resist. On a successful save, no form of this technique that allows a save can be used on them for the rest of the scene. Level-0: Observe emotional states in a target. Intense\nemotions provide a single word or image related to the focus of the feelings.\nLevel-1: A shallow gestalt with the target’s language centers allows the telepath to understand any form of communication made by the target. If the psychic has the requisite body parts to speak the target’s language, they can communicate with it in turn.\nLevel-2: The psychic’s awareness of the target’s surface cognition is sophisticated enough to read their current thoughts, though it can’t pick up memories or non-obvious connections. The target gets a Mental saving throw to resist this.\nLevel-3: The psychic can drill down into the target’s memory to get a one or two-sentence answer to any single question they ask, or receive a single answering vision of the target’s recollections. The target can attempt a Mental saving throw to resist this power, and whether or not it succeeds the contact is automatically ended. It can be re-established, but only by activating this technique again.\nLevel-4: The psychic instantly gets a full and nuanced awareness of everything the target can remember about a particular topic. The target can attempt a Mental saving throw to resist this power, and whether or not it succeeds the contact is automatically ended afterwards.

On a failure, the damage is tripled and the target is now affected by an obvious, lethal cancer that will kill them in 1d6 months. The cancer can be treated by a TL4 hospital or ship’s sick bay if managed within a month’s time. If the biopsion Commits Effort for the day instead of the scene, they can control the power sufficiently to do no hit point damage and create very subtle tumors, leaving the cancer undetectable without a TL4 medical examination.

Thermokinesis cannot affect objects larger than the adept could lift with their Telekinetic Manipulation.\nAs with other telekinetic powers, this ability does not work on objects being held or used by intelligent creatures.

You gain an ability equivalent to the level-0 core power of that discipline. Optionally, you may instead pick a level-1 technique from that discipline, but that technique must stand alone; you can’t pick one that augments another technique or core ability. For example, you could pick the Telekinetic Armory technique from Telekinesis, because that ability does not require the use of any other Telekinesis power. You could not pick the Mastered Succor ability from Biopsionics, because that technique is meant to augment another power you don’t have.\nLevel 2: You now have a maximum Effort of two points. You may pick a second ability according to the guidelines above. This second does not need to be a stand-alone technique if it augments the power you chose for level 1 of this focus. Thus, if your first pick was gaining the level-0 power of Psychic Succor, your second could be Mastered Succor. You still could not get the level-1 core power of Psychic Succor, however, as you’re still restricted to level-0.",
