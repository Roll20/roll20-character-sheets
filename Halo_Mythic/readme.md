TODO: Add Vehicle section to sheet fix look of custom skill and abilitys.

Most things you can roll directly from the sheet, by clicking on the corresponding name or the roll button at the end of the row. With weapons: Clicking on 'Name:' rolls an attack, clicking on 'Damage:' rolls the damage you have entered in the field next to it. Please just enter things like 1d10+2, because it will be transferred to an inline roll - no letters!

All characteristics are referenced by the first three letters of their name(e.g. @{STR} @{TOU} @{AGI} etc)
Mythic characteristics are referenced as @{mythic[stat]| (e.g. @{mythicstr})

Based on the Rogue Trader Character Sheet, which was based on the Neirin D. Dark Heresy Character Sheet
