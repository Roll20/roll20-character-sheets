If the animal does not roll a successful saving throw vs. spell immediately when the spell is begun, it stands quietly while the caster finishes the spell. Thereafter, it follows the caster about. The spell functions only if the caster actually wishes to be the animal’s friend. If the caster has ulterior motives, the animal always senses them (for example, the caster intends to eat the animal, send it ahead to set off traps, etc.).\n&emsp;The caster can teach the befriended animal three specific tricks or tasks for each point of Intelligence it possesses. Typical tasks are those taught to a dog or similar pet (i.e., they cannot be complex). Training for each such trick must be done over a period of one week, and all must be done within three months of acquiring the creature. During the three-month period, the animal will not harm the caster, but if the creature is left alone for more than a week, it will revert to its natural state and act accordingly.\n&emsp;The caster can use this spell to attract up to 2 Hit Dice of animal(s) per experience level he possesses. This is also the maximum total Hit Dice of the animals that can be attracted and trained at one time: no more than twice the caster’s experience level. Current maximum [[2*[[@{level-priest}]] ]] Hit Dice of animals. Only unaligned animals can be attracted, befriended, and trained.'

Furthermore, it raises their attack dice rolls by +1. A blessing, however, affects only those not already engaged in melee combat. The caster determines at what range (up to 60 yards) he will cast the spell. At the instant the spell is completed, it affects all creatures in a 50-foot cube centered on the point selected by the caster (thus, affected creatures leaving the area are still subject to the spell’s effect; those entering the area after the casting is completed are not).\n&emsp;A second use of this spell is to bless a single item (for example, a crossbow bolt for use against a rakshasa). The weight of the item is limited to one pound per caster level and the effect lasts until the item is used or the spell duration ends.\n&emsp;Multiple *bless* spells are not cumulative.\n&emsp;This spell can be reversed by the priest to a *curse* spell that, when cast upon enemy creatures, lowers their morale and attack rolls by –1.'

They lose all Armor Class bonuses for shield and Dexterity. If any of them has his concentration broken, the *combine* spell ends immediately. If the *combine* spell is broken while the central priest is in the act of casting a spell, that spell is ruined just as if the caster were disturbed.

A command to “Die!” causes the creature to fall in a faint or cataleptic state for one round, but thereafter the creature revives and is alive and well. Typical commands are back, halt, flee, run, stop, fall, go, leave, surrender, sleep, rest, etc. No command affects a creature for more than one round; undead are not affected at all.

Character alignment, however, is revealed only under unusual circumstances: characters who are strongly aligned, who do not stray from their faith, and who are of at least 9th level might radiate good or evil *if intent upon appropriate actions*. Powerful monsters, such as rakshasas or ki-rin, send forth emanations of evil or good, even if polymorphed. Aligned undead radiate evil, for it is this power and negative force that enable them to continue existing. An evilly cursed object or unholy water radiates evil, but a hidden trap or an unintelligent viper does not.\n&emsp;The degree of evil (*faint, moderate, strong, overwhelming*) and possibly its general nature (*expectant, malignant, gloating*, etc.) can be noted. If the evil is overwhelming, the priest has a 10% chance per level (currently [[{10*[[@{level-priest}]],100}kl1]]% chance) of detecting its general bent (*lawful, neutral, chaotic*). The duration of a *detect evil* spell is one turn plus five rounds per level of the priest. Thus, a 1st-level priest can cast a spell with a 15-round duration, a 2nd-level priest can cast a spell with a 20-round duration, etc. The spell has a path of detection 10 feet wide in the direction the priest is facing.

The spell is directional—the caster must face the desired direction to determine if a pit exists or a trap is laid in that direction. The caster experiences a feeling of danger from the direction of a detected hazard, which increases as the danger is approached. The caster learns the general nature of the danger (pit, snare, or deadfall) but not its exact operation, nor how to disarm it. Close examination, however, enables the caster to sense what intended actions might trigger it.

The spell lasts one round per level of experience of the caster, while the length of the path is 100 yards plus 20 yards per level of experience. (At the DM’s option, some casters may be able to locate only those animals [or plants] associated closely with their own mythos.) While the exact chance of locating a specific type of animal or plant depends on the details and circumstances of the locale, the general frequency of the subject can be used as a guideline: common = 50%, uncommon = 30%, rare = 15%, and very rare = 5%. Most herbs grow in temperate regions, while most spices grow in tropical regions. Most plants sought as spell components or for magical research are rare or very rare. The results of this spell are always determined by the DM.'

Note that this spell is directional, and the caster must face the desired direction in order to determine if a trap is laid in that particular direction.\n&emsp;A trap is any device or magical ward that meets three criteria: it can inflict a sudden or unexpected result, the spellcaster would view the result as undesirable or harmful, and the harmful or undesirable result was specifically intended as such by the creator. Thus, traps include alarms, glyphs, and similar spells or devices.\n&emsp;The caster learns the general nature of the trap (magical or mechanical) but not its exact effect, nor how to disarm it. Close examination will, however, enable the caster to sense what intended actions might trigger it. Note that the caster’s divination is limited to his knowledge of what might be unexpected and harmful. The spell cannot predict actions of creatures (hence, a concealed murder hole or ambush is not a trap), nor are natural hazards considered traps (a cavern that floods during a rain, a wall weakened by age, a naturally poisonous plant, etc.). If the DM is using specific glyphs or sigils to identify magical wards (see the 3rd-level spell *glyph of warding*), this spell shows the form of the glyph or mark. The spell does not detect traps that have been disarmed or are otherwise inactive.'

The base damage inflicted when it scores a hit is exactly the same as a normal war hammer (1d4+1 points on opponents of man size or smaller, or 1d4 points on larger opponents, plus the magical bonus). The hammer strikes in the same direction as the caster is facing, so if he is behind the target, all bonuses for rear attack are gained along with the loss of any modifications to the target’s AC for shield and Dexterity.\n&emsp;As soon as the caster ceases concentration, the *spiritual hammer* spell ends. A *dispel magic* spell that includes either the caster or the force in its area of effect has a chance to dispel the spiritual hammer. If an attacked creature has magic resistance, the resistance is checked the first time the spiritual hammer strikes. If the hammer is successfully resisted, the spell is lost. If not, the hammer has its normal full effect for the duration of the spell.\n&emsp;The material component of this spell is a normal war hammer that the priest must hurl toward opponents while uttering a plea to his deity. The hammer disappears when the spell is cast.'

The casting of any of these spells in different fashion (for example, a *cure light wounds* spell bestowed upon a companion) negates the *withdraw* spell. Similarly, the withdrawn caster cannot walk or run, become invisible, or engage in actions other than thinking, reading, and the like.

The caster can always dispel his own magic; otherwise the chance to dispel depends on the difference in level between the magical effect and the caster. The base chance is 50% (11 or higher on 1d20 to dispel). If the caster is of higher level than the creator of the effect to be dispelled, the difference is *subtracted* from the number needed on 1d20 to dispel (making it *more* likely that the dispel succeeds).

If the potion’s effects extend to other creatures (such as the various potions of control) it can be dispelled normally with an **area effect** cast. All potion effects are treated as magic cast at 12th level for purposes of dispelling.\n&emsp;*Second,* it ***disrupts*** spell casting, scroll reading, and some device activation in the area of effect at the instant the *dispel* is cast. Spell-casting and magical-item use count as actions. A character cannot perform a second action in the same round even if the spell or item’s effect is disrupted.\n&emsp;• Spells and scrolls are used up and lost when disrupted.\n&emsp;• If the optional command word rule is in use, then majority of wands, staves, and rods can be disrupted.

The caster’s own magic is always automatically dispelled; otherwise, the effect or potion is dispelled if its level is less than or equal to 1d20 + 1 per level of the caster, - 11. Thus, a 6th level spellcaster, rolling a 13, gives a final value of 13+6-11 = 8, causing an effect cast by a spellcaster or device of 8th level or below to be dispelled. A roll of 20 always succeeds and a roll of 1 always fails. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic he is trying to dispel, only a roll of 1 prevents the effect from being dispelled.\n\n&emsp;**Targeted:** Casting *dispel magic* on a creature, item, or object does not radiate an area of effect. Thus, spells such as *stoneskin, minor globe of invulnerability* and *barkskin* could not be dispelled as the result of trying to negate the *magic of a wand of lightning*.\n&emsp;*Targeted on a magical item:* A *dispel magic* spell only affects a specially enchanted item–such as a magical scroll, ring, wand, rod, staff, miscellaneous item, weapon, shield, or armor–if it is cast directly upon that item alone. An unattended magical item is automatically nonoperational for 1d4 rounds. If the item is possessed or carried by a creature it gains the creature’s saving throw against this effect. An interdimensional interface (such as a *bag of holding*) rendered nonoperational would be temporarily closed. Note that an item’s physical properties are unchanged: A nonoperational magical sword is still a sword.\n&emsp;*Targeted on a creature:* A creature hit by a **targeted** *dispel magic* suffers the first two effects: ***Removal*** of spell effects, including potion effects that only apply to the creature, and ***disruption*** of spell casting as described above. It is up to the DM if the third effect, ***destruction of magical potions***, is also included.\n\n&emsp;**Permanency:** Spells made permanent with *permanency* can be dispelled. When dispelled, a permanent spell is destroyed, not temporarily rendered nonoperational. A creature or item never gains a saving throw to avoid a dispelling attempt against its permanent effects. To dispel a permanent spell the follows conditions must always be fulfilled:\n&emsp;1) Permanent spells must be individually **targeted** to be dispelled, requiring a separate *dispel magic* for each permanent effect.\n&emsp;2) The dispeller must make a successful **dispel roll** as described above.\n&emsp;3) Removing a permanent spell effect from a creature or magical item also requires that the dispeller is of higher level than the *permanency* caster at the time *permanency* was cast.\n\n&emsp;**Artifacts and relics:** Are not subject to this spell; however, some of their spell-like effects may be, at the DM’s option.\n&emsp;**Instantaneous effects:** Spells and potions whose basic durations are instantaneous cannot be dispelled. A *cure light wounds* spell or *potion of extra-healing*, cannot be dispelled after their healing properties have occurred. Likewise, petrification effect such as *flesh to stone* cannot be dispelled.\n&emsp;Note the this spell can be very effective when used upon charmed or similarly beguiled creatures. Certain spells or effects cannot be dispelled (such as a *protection from magic scroll* effect); these are listed in the spell descriptions.\n\n**Summary of *Dispel Magic* Effects**}}{{style=bottom3}}{{cc1-1=bottom}}{{c1-1=**Source of Effect**}}{{c2-1=Caster}}{{c3-1=Other caster/-\n&emsp;innate ability}}{{c4-1=Wand}}{{c5-1=Staff}}{{c6-1=Potion}}{{c7-1=Other magic item}}{{c8-1=Artifact}}{{cc1-2=bottom}}{{c1-2=**Resists As**}}{{c2-2=None}}{{c3-2=Leve/HD of\n&emsp;other caster}}{{c4-2=6th level}}{{c5-2=8th level}}{{c6-2=12th level}}{{c7-2=12th, unless special}}{{c8-2=DM discretion}}{{c1-3=**Result of Dispel**}}{{c2-3=Dispel automatic}}{{c3-3=Effect negated}}{{c4-3=&ast;}}{{c5-3=&ast;}}{{c6-3=Potion destroyed}}{{c7-3=&ast;}}{{c8-3=DM discretion}}{{cs9-1=3}}{{cc9-1=justify}}{{c9-1=\n&ast; Effect negated; if cast directly on item, item becomes nonoperational for 1d4 rounds.}}{{cs10-1=3}}{{cc10-1=center}}{{c10-1=[Dispel Roll](~@{character_name}|dispel-setup-pri)'

It can be used to guard a small bridge, to ward an entry, or as a trap on a chest or box.\n&emsp;The priest must set the conditions of the ward; typically any creature violating the warded area without speaking the name of the glyph is subject to the magic it stores. A successful saving throw vs. spell enables the creature to escape the effects of the glyph. Glyphs can be set according to physical characteristics, such as creature type, size, and weight. Glyphs can also be set with respect to good or evil, or to pass those of the caster’s religion. They cannot be set according to class, Hit Dice, or level. Multiple glyphs cannot be cast on the same area; although if a cabinet had three drawers, each could be separately warded.\n&emsp;When the spell is cast, the priest weaves a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. For every 5 square feet of area to be protected, one round is required to trace the warding lines of the glyph. The caster can affect an area equal to a square the sides of which are the same as his level, in feet. The glyph can be placed to conform to any shape up to the limitations of the caster’s total square footage. Thus, a 6th-level caster could place a glyph on a 6-foot × 6-foot square, a 4-foot × 9-foot rectangle, a 2-foot × 18-foot band, or a 1-foot by 36-foot strip. When the spell is completed, the glyph and tracery become invisible.\n&emsp;The priest traces the glyph with incense, which, if the area exceeds 50 square feet, must be sprinkled with powdered diamond (at least 2,000 gp worth).\n&emsp;Typical glyphs shock for 1d4 points of electrical damage per level of the spellcaster, explode for a like amount of fire damage, paralyze, blind, deafen, and so forth. The DM may allow any harmful priest spell effect to be used as a glyph, provided the caster is of sufficient level to cast the spell. Successful saving throws either reduce effects by one-half or negate them, according to the glyph employed. Glyphs cannot be affected or bypassed by such means as physical or magical probing, though they can be dispelled by magic and foiled by high-level thieves using their find-and-remove-traps skill.\n&emsp;The DM may decide that the exact glyphs available to a priest depend on his religion, and he might make new glyphs available according to the magical research rules.'

The curse can have one of the following effects (roll percentile dice): 50% of the time it reduces one ability of the victim to 3 (the DM randomly determines which ability); 25% of the time it lowers the victim’s attack and saving throw rolls by –4; 25% of the time it makes the victim 50% likely to drop whatever he is holding (or do nothing, in the case of creatures not using tools)—roll each round.\n&emsp;It is possible for a priest to devise his own curse, and it should be similar in power to those given here. Consult your DM. The subject of a *bestow curse* spell must be touched. If the victim is touched, a saving throw is still applicable; if it is successful, the effect is negated. The bestowed curse cannot be dispelled.'

If no such sapling or tree is available, the cordlike object tightens upon the member(s), then wraps around the entire creature, causing no damage, but tightly binding it. Under water, the cord coils back upon its anchor point.

Flying insects of 3 Hit Dice or more can carry a rider of human size (assume that such can carry 80 pounds per Hit Die).\n&emsp;If the casting is interrupted for any reason, or if the insects are currently subject to any other magical effect (including this one), the insects die and the spell is ruined. The DM decides how many normal insects of what type are available; this is often a greater limitation on the spell than the limits above.\n&emsp;If the insect created by this spell matches an existing monster description, use the monster description. Otherwise, unless the DM creates a special description, the giant form has an Armor Class of between 8 and 4, one attack, and inflicts 1d4 points of damage per Hit Die.\n&emsp;For example, a 14th-level priest uses the giant insect spell to enlarge one beetle (all that is available) to 6 HD size. The DM decides the beetle has AC 5 and bites for 6d4 points of damage.\n&emsp;Note that the spell works only on actual insects. Arachnids, crustaceans, and other types of small creatures are not affected. Any giant insects created by this spell do not attempt to harm the priest, but the priest’s control of such creatures is limited to simple commands (“attack,” “defend,” “guard,” and so forth). Orders to attack a certain creature when it appears or guard against a particular occurrence are too complex. Unless commanded to do otherwise, the giant insects attempt to attack whoever or whatever is near them.\n&emsp;The reverse of the spell, *shrink insect,* reduces any giant insect to normal insect size. The number of Hit Dice affected by the priest is subtracted from the number of Hit Dice of the insects, and any insect reduced to 0 Hit Dice has been shrunk. Partial shrinking is ignored; an insect is either shrunk or unaffected. Thus, a 9th-level priest attacked by giant ants could shrink three warrior ants or four worker ants to normal insect size with no saving throw.

Currently [[5*[[@{level-priest}]] ]]% chance: *detect magic, detect snares and pits,* and *detect poison.* Each additional detection attempt requires a round of concentration, regardless of success.

The animated object, or objects, then attacks whomever or whatever the priest first designates. The animated object can be of any nonmagical material whatsoever—wood, metal, stone, fabric, leather, ceramic, glass, etc. Attempting to animate an object in someone’s possession grants that person a saving throw to prevent the spell’s effect. The speed of movement of the object depends on its means of propulsion and its weight. A large wooden table would be rather heavy, but its legs would give it speed. A rug could only slither along. A jar would roll. Thus a large stone pedestal would rock forward at 10 feet per round, a stone statue would move at 40 feet per round, a wooden statue 80 feet per round, an ivory stool of light weight would move at 120 feet per round. Slithering movement is about 10 feet to 20 feet per round; rolling is 30 feet to 60 feet per round. The damage caused by the attack of an animated object depends on its form and composition. Light, supple objects can only obscure vision, obstruct movement, bind, trip, smother, etc. Light, hard objects can fall upon or otherwise strike for 1d2 points of damage or possibly obstruct and trip, as do light, supple objects. Hard, medium-weight objects can crush or strike for 2d4 points of damage, while larger and heavier objects may inflict 3d4, 4d4, or even 5d4 points of damage.\n&emsp;The frequency of attack of animated objects depends on their method of locomotion, appendages, and method of attack. This varies from as seldom as once every five melee rounds to as frequently as once per round. The Armor Class of the object animated is basically a function of material and movement ability. Damage depends on the type of weapon and the object struck. A sharp cutting weapon is effective against fabric, leather, wood, and like substances. Heavy smashing and crushing weapons are useful against wood, stone, and metal objects. Your DM will determine all of these factors, as well as how much damage the animated object can sustain before being destroyed. The priest can animate one cubic foot of material for each experience level he has attained. Thus, a 14th-level priest could animate one or more objects whose solid volume did not exceed 14 cubic feet—a large statue, two rugs, three chairs, or a dozen average crocks.'

The damage is based on each 10-foot thickness of the barrier.\n&emsp;If the wall of thorns is chopped at, it takes at least four turns to cut a path through a 10-foot thickness. Normal fire cannot harm the barrier, but magical fires burn away the barrier in two turns, creating a wall of fire effect while doing so (see *wall of fire* spell). In this case, the cool side of the wall is that closest to the caster of the thorn wall.\n&emsp;The nearest edge of the wall of thorns appears up to 80 yards distant from the caster, as he desires. The spell’s duration is one turn for each level of experience of the caster, and it covers one 10-foot cube per level of the caster in whatever shape the caster desires. Thus a 14th-level caster could create a wall of thorns up to 70 feet long by 20 feet high (or deep) by 10 feet deep (or high), a 10-foot-high by 10-foot-wide by 140-foot-long wall to block a dungeon passage, or any other sort of shape that suited his needs. The caster can also create a wall of 5-foot thickness, which inflicts half damage but can be doubled in one of the other dimensions. Note that those with the ability to pass through overgrown areas are not hindered by this barrier. The caster can dismiss the barrier on command.'

When a second body is formed on a different plane, the silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new body. If the second body or astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to the caster’s body where the body rests on the Prime Material plane, reviving it from its state of suspended animation. Although astral projections are able to function on the Astral plane, their actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral plane; a physical body must be materialized on other planes.\n&emsp;The spell lasts until the priest desires to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as *dispel magic* spell or destruction of the priest’s body on the Prime Material plane—which kills the priest. The priest can project the astral forms of up to seven other creatures with himself by means of the *astral* spell, providing the creatures are linked in a circle with the priest. These fellow travelers are dependent upon the priest and can be stranded if something happens to the priest. Travel in the Astral plane can be slow or fast, according to the priest’s desire.

Note that an absolute (true) neutral creature is effectively opposed to both good and evil, and both law and chaos.\n&emsp;The spellcaster must know something about the creature to exact service from it, or else he must offer some fair trade in return for the service. That is, if the priest is aware that the creature has received some favor from someone of the priest’s alignment, then the *exaction* spell can name this as cause. If no balancing reason for service is known, then some valuable gift or service must be pledged in return for the exaction. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the past or promised favor or reward, and with the being’s effort and risk. The spell then acts, subject to a magic resistance roll, as a quest upon the being that is to perform the required service. Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to the vicinity of the priest, and the priest must then and there return the promised reward, whether it is irrevocable cancellation of a past debt or the giving of some service or other material reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane.\n&emsp;The DM adjudicates when an equitable arrangement has been reached. If the caster requests too much, the creature is free to depart or to attack the priest (as if the agreement were breached) according to its nature. If circumstances leave the situation unbalanced (for example, the creature dies while achieving a result that was not worth dying for), then this might create a debt owed by the caster to the creature’s surviving kith and kin, making the caster vulnerable to a future *exaction* spell from that quarter. Agreeing to a future exaction or release in the event of catastrophic failure or death are common caster pledges in securing an exaction. Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in the priest being subject to exaction by the subject creature or by its master, liege, etc., at the very least.

Although the ink forms groups of letters arranged in lines with punctuation, nearly all the words are meaningless. This may appear to be some sort of code, but it means nothing.\n&emsp;*Day Five:* The ink has formed real words. However, the sentence construction is still meaningless (e.g., Egg west worse green!).\n&emsp;*Day Six (and beyond):* The message is coherent, but the opposite intent of the original message has been created.

    'effect': 'One of the more bizarre contentions held by priests of the School of Thought is generally scoffed at by outsiders. The theory states that once a thought has occurred in someone’s brain, it exists as a “freestanding mental object.” This “thought object” usually remains inside the brain of the creature that created it, but sometimes it escapes (this supposedly explains why people forget things). When this happens, the thought object stays in the geographical area where it was lost. Any receptive brain (usually the brain of the creature that initially created the thought) can pick it up again simply by bumping into the invisible, free-floating thought. According to the theory, this is the reason that people can regain a lost thought by going back to the location where the thought was lost. This supposedly works because the free-floating thought is recaptured, not because the locale reminds them of the thought. Unfortunately for philosophers who disagree with this, *thought capture* seems to be extremely strong evidence for this theory.\n&emsp;This spell makes the priest’s brain something of a magnet that attracts thought objects in close proximity. The priest can sense strong thoughts and emotions and can sometimes even see momentary visions of creatures who died or suffered some powerful emotion in the immediate vicinity. Thought objects are always attracted to the priest in the order of the strongest (those attached to powerful emotions or significant events) to the weakest. Thus, if several thought objects share the same vicinity, the priest will perceive information about the most interesting or significant event. The priest might pick up images of a battle from the point of view of a warrior who died there, or he might gain information about the victor of the battle.\n&emsp;The DM dictates the information provided to the priest, and thus can use this spell to provide players with important background information or can add texture to a campaign world. The information provided might be highly cryptic or symbolic, perhaps in the form of a rhyme or riddle.\n&emsp;The priest gains one thought object per casting of the spell. The spell may be cast a number of times in the same locale, with the priest gaining a different thought object with each casting. A locale contains a finite number of thoughts, however, and once the priest has gained all of them (per the DM), the spell will fail in that locale.'

If successful, all characters affected by the spell are compelled to stop what they are doing. They are filled with the sensation that something important is about to occur. At this time, the priest or a character of his choosing must gain the attention of the affected creatures by giving a speech, performing for the crowd, or casting spells with intriguing visual effects (such as *dancing lights*). The attention of the crowd is then held for as long as the distraction continues.

When used in combat, the priest can advise the best moment to initiate an action (affecting initiative) or what moment offers the greatest success in striking (affecting the chance to hit).\n&emsp;If the character seeks advice concerning initiative, he gains a -2 modifier to the initiative roll, but only at the cost of -2 on his chance to hit. Characters who seek the best attack frequently delay their actions. These characters suffer a +1 on their initiative roll but gain a +4 on their chance to hit. The spell cannot affect the amount of damage caused, since the act (striking) has already succeeded at that point.\n&emsp;Characters are not obliged to wait for the moment specified by the priest. For example, a fighter might decide that striking first is more important than gaining +4 to hit. The character can act normally, based on his or her unmodified initiative. The character gains no bonus from the *moment* spell, and the priest can affect no other action in that round.\n&emsp;Noncombat actions can also benefit from the *moment* spell. For example, a thief planning to climb a wall may wait to start her climb until the priest informs her that the moment is right. If she waits, she gains a bonus of 20% to her Climb Walls roll (in this case, the bonus is *subtracted* from her roll).\n&emsp;While concentrating on this spell, the priest can take no other action.

The priest and unit must be within 100 yards of a place of worship dedicated to the casting priest’s deity. The casting time is 5 turns.\n&emsp;At the conclusion of the casting, the unit gains the benefit described above, with two main differences. First, the unit does not lose the benefit of fighting in its own actual favored terrain (the unit effectively has two favored terrains). Second, the spell endures until the next sunset.

Fear counters (and is countered by) courage.\n&emsp;*Friendship:* The subject reacts positively to any encounter; in game terms, any result of a roll on the Encounter Reactions table (Table 59 in the *DMG*) is moved one column to the left. Thus, a threatening PC becomes cautious, an indifferent PC becomes friendly, etc. Friendship counters (and is countered by) hate.\n&emsp;*Happiness:* The subject experiences feelings of warmth, well-being, and confidence, modifying all reaction rolls by +3.

    'effect': 'This spell allows the priest to determine the “tenor of the now”—in other words, to learn the “force” that is most dominant at the time. To cast the spell, the priest generates a series of random numbers and then studies the pattern contained in that string of numbers. This pattern contains information about current conditions.\n&emsp;In game terms, when this spell is cast, the DM communicates to the priest’s player a single word or short phrase (no more than five words) describing the “tone” of the situation. Examples of suitable “tones” are “imminent danger” (the DM knows a dragon is approaching the area); “peace and tranquility” (the woods in which the PCs camp may look threatening, but the area is actually free of evil influence); or “betrayal” (one of the PCs’ hirelings is actually a spy of their enemy). The DM can make this comment cryptic, but it should always be accurate and contain some useful information.\n&emsp;This spell has no specified area of effect. The result of *moment reading* will always concern the priest and anyone else in his immediate vicinity, but the definition of “vicinity” will vary depending on the circumstances. For example, the tenor of the moment might be “severe danger” if the priest is entering the territory of a dragon who attacks interlopers on sight.\n&emsp;The tenor of the moment is always personally applicable to the priest. For example, even if the priest is in a nation dangerously close to war with its neighbor, this condition will not appear in the tenor of the moment unless the priest is personally involved (if he’s currently in the direct path of an invading army, for instance).\n&emsp;One casting of this spell tends to “taint” subsequent castings of the same spell unless they are separated by a minimum length of time. If a priest casts this spell twice within 12 hours, the second reading gives the same result as the first, regardless of the actual situation. If a second priest casts the spell within 12 hours of another priest’s use of the spell, he receives an accurate reading.'

At 10th level or lower, *addition* can create a single, inanimate object weighing up to 10 pounds. The spell gives the priest only rudimentary control over the creation process, so the object cannot be complex. The object must be described in a single word or short phrase (e.g., “a water pitcher” or “a block of stone”). The caster has no control over elements such as shape or color; thus, the water pitcher might be short, squat, and blue, or tall, slender, and red.\n&emsp;Objects created with this spell cannot be of any greater mechanical complexity or technological level than a crossbow. If the priest tries to create an object that breaks this prohibition, the spell fails and nothing is created. Thus, if the priest tried to create “a pistol,” assuming he had heard the word somewhere, the spell would fail.\n&emsp;Objects cannot contain any information in an abstract form such as writing or diagrams. If the priest tries to create an object that breaks this prohibition, there are two possible results: the spell may fail, or the object may be created without the information. Thus, if the priest were to attempt to create “a spellbook,” the result would be either a book similar to a spellbook with blank pages, or nothing at all.\n&emsp;The object appears at whatever location the caster wills, as long as it is within spell range. The object cannot appear in the same space occupied by another object or creature, or within a hollow object (for example, the priest cannot create an object blocking the trachea of an enemy).\n&emsp;The object created by *addition* remains in existence for 1 turn per level of the caster. Currently [[@{level-priest}]] turns. During this time, it obeys all the laws of physics as if it were a “real” object. The object cannot be disbelieved and spells such as *true seeing* cannot distinguish it from a naturally-occurring object.\n&emsp;Priests of 11th to 15th level can create a single inanimate object of up to 20 pounds in mass or two identical objects, each of up to five pounds in mass. The object(s) so created remains in existence for two hours (12 turns) per level of the caster.

    'effect': 'This spell allows the caster to selectively warp the fabric of space, folding it into higher dimensions.\n&emsp;This effect can be best explained through an example. If an ant crawling along the west edge of a map decided to travel to the east edge of the map, it would have to crawl the full width of the map. But if the map were folded in two so that the east and west edges were touching, the ant would travel almost no distance at all. The ant’s world (the map) would have been folded through the third dimension. The *dimensional folding* spell does something similar with the three-dimensional world: it folds it through a higher dimension (the fourth), allowing instantaneous travel between two locales on the same plane of existence.\n&emsp;Although this effect may seem similar to the wizard spell *teleport*, in practice, it is much different. The *dimensional folding* spell opens a gate that allows instantaneous, bidirectional access to a distant locale on the same plane. This gate is circular, of any size up to 10’ in diameter, and remains in existence for up to 1 full round. The caster and any other creatures can pass through the gate in either direction while it remains open. Missile weapons and magic spells can also pass through the gate.\n&emsp;The gate appears as a shimmering ring, glowing with a faint light equivalent to starshine. Vision through the gate is clear and unobstructed in both directions, allowing the priest to “look before he leaps.” However, anyone on the other side of the gate is able to see the priest and his point of origin.\n&emsp;The “near side” of the gate always appears within 5 feet of the priest. The location of the “far side” of the gate always opens within 5 feet of the place the priest desires. Thus, there is no chance of arriving at the wrong destination, as with the wizard spell *teleport*.\n&emsp;There is a risk involved in using *dimensional folding*, however. Many philosophers believe that what we know as time is simply another dimension, and the behavior of this spell seems to support this thesis. Unless the priest is extremely familiar with the destination, there is a significant chance that any creature passing through a *dimensional folding* gate will suffer instantaneous aging. Theorists believe that this is the same kind of “slippage” that can cause a *teleporting* wizard to land high or low, except that in this case, the slippage is in the time dimension.\n&emsp;The chance of this instantaneous aging occurring depends on how familiar the priest is with the destination. The table that follows outlines the conditions and effects of aging.}}{{style=bottom2 sheet-spell-center2 sheet-spell-bottom3 sheet-spell-center3}}{{cc1-1=bottom}}{{c1-1=**Destination is:**}}{{c2-1=Very familiar*}}{{c3-1=Studied carefully}}{{c4-1=Seen casually}}{{c5-1=Viewed once}}{{c6-1=Never seen}}{{c1-2=**Chance of**\n**aging**}}{{c2-2=2%}}{{c3-2=5%}}{{c4-2=10%}}{{c5-2=15%}}{{c6-2=25%}}{{c1-3=**Amount of**\n**aging**}}{{c2-3=1 year}}{{c3-3=1d2 years}}{{c4-3=1d3 years}}{{c5-3=1d6 years}}{{c6-3=1d10 years}}{{effects2=&emsp;* Use this row if the desired location is within view of the priest.\n\n&emsp;If the die roll indicates that aging occurs, every creature that passes through the gate in either direction suffers the aging effect. Multiple creatures passing through the gate in the same direction all age by the same amount determined by a single die roll. Although the chance of aging is low and the potential amount of aging is minimal for familiar destinations, the effects can add up and become significant over time.\n&emsp;Although the word “destination” is used to refer to the “far end” of the gate, the priest need not be the one doing the traveling. For example, a priest may open the gate near a distant ally so he may travel instantaneously to join the priest.'

    'effect': 'This spell creates the necessary conditions for devotional energy to be used. For faith magic to work, the priest must create a focus to harness the necessary devotional energy. This spell creates that focus. *A focus cannot function without a source of devotional energy*.\n&emsp;The focus gathers devotional energy and reshapes it in order to amplify other spells cast by the priest (or priests). The same energy keeps the focus in existence. If the spell is cast and there is no immediate source of devotional energy within 100 feet, the *focus* immediately fails.\n&emsp;Once created, most foci cannot be moved. This condition and the need for a constant supply of devotional energy tends to limit the use of foci to temples, churches, monasteries, shrines, and seminaries—permanent structures where followers of the religion gather on a regular basis. Sometimes a focus is created for a special gathering such as a holy day, conclave, grand wedding, or yearly festival.\n&emsp;Not all foci are identical. The particular form of the focus depends on the power and nature of the spell being amplified. All foci can be seen by *detect magic*. There are three basic types of foci: site, item, and living.\n&emsp;**Site foci** are connected to a place, whether a room, building, field, or forest. Once cast, the foci cannot be moved. It causes no disturbance in the surroundings; it is invisible and intangible.\n&emsp;**Item foci** are centered on a single object. Customarily, this object is large and immovable, such as an altar, but it is possible for the focus to be as small as is practical. The item can be as elaborate or plain as desired, but should have some significance to the religion.\n&emsp;**Living foci** are the rarest of all types. In this case, the focus is created on a living plant, animal, or person. *Detect charm* reveals the person is somehow enchanted, although not under the influence of a typical charm spell.\n&emsp;The type of focus created (site, item, or living) depends on the religion and nature of the spell amplified. These choices are listed in Table 3: Focused Spell Effects.\n&emsp;Casting the *focus* spell is a long and complicated process, accompanied by many ceremonies and rituals. During the day spent casting the spell, the priest will need the assistance of at least two other priests of the same faith. These aides need not memorize the spell (or even be capable of casting it). Their duty is to provide the extra hands and voices needed at specific points of the casting. A large number of worshipers must also be present since the focus requires their energy. Not surprisingly, the casting of this spell is often incorporated into important holy festivals or special occasions.\n&emsp;The duration of the focus is one year. If the devotional energy falls below a minimum level, the spell ends sooner. A focus requires the devotional energy of at least 100 devout worshipers. Lay monks (those dedicated to the religion but not priests) count as two worshipers, while priests (of any level) count as ten. A focus could be maintained by a congregation of 100, a monastery of fifty, or a seminary of as few as 10 priests (or any combination of the above). The focus must receive this energy for at least 10 hours out of every day. If these conditions are not met, the focus weakens. The area of effect of the amplified spell decreases by 20% each day until it fades away completely.\n&emsp;Once the focus is created, the priest or priests have 1 turn in which to cast the desired spell upon the focus. A focus can amplify only one spell, and each item, creature, or place can receive only one focus. Spells that can be cast upon a focus are listed on Table 3.\n\n**Table 3: FOCUSED SPELL EFFECTS**}}{{style=bottom2 sheet-spell-center2}}{{cc1-1=bottom}}{{c1-1=**Spell**}}{{c2-1=*Anti-animal shell*}}{{c3-1=*Anti-plant shell*}}{{c4-1=*Bless*}}{{c5-1=*Control temperature, 10’ radius*}}{{c6-1=*Control winds*}}{{c7-1=*Cure disease*}}{{c8-1=*Cure blindness or deafness*}}{{c9-1=*Detect poison*}}{{c10-1=*Detect lie*}}{{c11-1=*Detect magic*}}{{c12-1=*Dispel evil*}}{{c13-1=*Endure cold/endure heat*}}{{c14-1=*Know alignment*}}{{c15-1=*Negative plane protection*}}{{c16-1=*Protection from evil*}}{{c17-1=*Protection from lightning*}}{{c18-1=*Protections from fire*}}{{c19-1=*Purify food and drink*}}{{c20-1=*Remove fear*}}{{c21-1=*Remove curse*}}{{c22-1=*Repel insects*}}{{c23-1=*Resist fire/resist cold*}}{{c24-1=*Speak with animals*}}{{c25-1=*Tongues*}}{{c26-1=*True seeing*}}{{c1-2=**Possible**\n**Focus**\n**Type**}}{{c2-2=S/I/L}}{{c3-2=S/I/L}}{{c4-2=S/I}}{{c5-2=S&ast;}}{{c6-2=S/I&ast;}}{{c7-2=I/L}}{{c8-2=I/L}}{{c9-2=S/I}}{{c10-2=I}}{{c11-2=I}}{{c12-2=S/I}}{{c13-2=S&ast;}}{{c14-2=I/L}}{{c15-2=S/I}}{{c16-2=S/I}}{{c17-2=S}}{{c18-2=S}}{{c19-2=I}}{{c20-2=S/I/L}}{{c21-2=I}}{{c22-2=S/I}}{{c23-2=S}}{{c24-2=S/I/L}}{{c25-2=S/I}}{{c26-2=S}}{{effects2=*&ast; The caster must state a desired range (temperature, wind strength, etc.) within the spell’s normal limitations at the time it is cast.*\n\n&emsp;Once the spell is cast, the normal duration and area of effect for that spell are ignored.

The priest may cast this spell on himself.\n&emsp;For a noncombat action such as an attempt to climb a wall, the priest simply casts the spell on the subject immediately before the action is attempted, informing the DM whether the modification is positive or negative. To use this spell in combat, the priest must specify the action to be affected (e.g., the target’s next attack roll) and whether the modification will be positive or negative. The spell remains in effect until the subject attempts the specified action or until a number of rounds equal to the caster’s level passes. Currently [[@{level-priest}]] rounds.

Characters trying to believe the reality of a solipsistic illusion must make a saving throw vs. breath weapon, modified by the magical defense adjustment for Wisdom. A successful save means that the character believes the illusion and it is part of reality for him. A failed save means that the character cannot convince himself of the illusion’s reality, and the illusion has no effect on him. A character can make a single attempt to believe each round.\n&emsp;Unlike true illusions, the image created by this spell does more than just duplicate reality. The image formed is *real* for those who believe in it. The illusion has all the normal properties that its form and function allow. Thus, a solipsistic bridge spanning a chasm could be crossed by the priest and those who believed. All others would see the priest apparently walking out onto nothingness. Likewise, a solipsistic giant would cause real damage to those who believed it.\n&emsp;The illusion remains in effect for as long as the priest continues to concentrate on it, until the priest is struck in combat, or until he is rendered unconscious. The level of concentration required is not extreme; the priest can move normally and may engage in combat, but is unable to cast any spell while maintaining a *solipsistic* illusion.\n&emsp;*Solipsism* can create only illusions that are external to the priest. Thus, the priest cannot create an illusion that he is the size of a giant, is unwounded, or has sprouted wings.'

This “arcane message” is normally straightforward and easy to understand, but in the case of highly complex circumstances, the message might be cryptic. In any case, the message will always be truthful.\n&emsp;As an example, consider a priest and his party who are on a holy quest to retrieve an item of power. On the way to the location of this item, the party is ambushed by evil creatures from the Inner Planes but manages to defeat them. Concerned that these creatures might be outlying guards protecting the item of interest, the priest casts *consequence*, hoping for guidance. The DM knows that these creatures have nothing to do with the quest; the encounter was coincidental. However, the surviving monsters will soon be returning with reinforcements to avenge their dead. Therefore, the DM tells the priest’s player, “To your goals these have no place, but still they can cause more woe.”\n&emsp;Casting this spell “taints” subsequent castings of the same spell within a 24-hour span.

While the recipient does not lose his own persona or ability to act, the host can be dominated by the caster at any time. For the most part, this domination is complete.\n&emsp;For the duration of the spell, the caster is essentially detached from his own body. He can neither move nor act on his own. His mind is connected to the host’s. He sees, hears, smells, tastes, and otherwise senses everything the host does. He can telepathically communicate with the host. Once the spell is completed, there is no limit to the range over which it can function. However, both the caster and host must remain on the same plane. Since the spell relies on telepathic communication, thin lead sheeting will effectively block the connection.\n&emsp;When desired, the caster can dominate the host. When this happens, the host’s own mind is pushed to the background and the caster’s personality dominates. The host’s personality, memories, proficiencies, and spells are temporarily replaced by those of the caster. While occupying the host, the caster can cast any spell he himself has memorized, provided that the necessary components are on hand. These spells function exactly as if the priest had cast them from his own body.\n&emsp;The caster can return control to the host at any time, restoring the character’s abilities and personality without harm.\n&emsp;The spell is not without limitations and risks. The domination must be voluntary. If the host resists the casting of the spell, it automatically fails. Once the spell is in effect, the host can attempt to resist the domination. He is then allowed a saving throw. If successful, the spell immediately ends.\n&emsp;Whenever the host suffers damage, the caster must make a saving throw vs. death to maintain the spell. If the save is failed, a wave of pain is transmitted to the priest, causing 1d6 points of damage and canceling the spell. If the host should die, the caster must make a system shock roll with the risk of suffering instant death.'

As long as the subject is able to maintain concentration, he may act normally within these limits.\n&emsp;If the subject is distracted (he is struck in combat, affected by a spell, startled, surprised, or a similar event occurs), he forgets everything that occurred from the onset of the spell to the moment of distraction. The subject must re-evaluate the situation as if it had just come to pass.\n&emsp;Consider the following example. The subject of the spell is a soldier assigned to guard the entrance to a building. The priest arrives and casts *memory wrack* on the guard. The guard has no problem remembering his orders, since he received them before the onset of the spell. He also remembers the arrival of the priest. The priest now tries to convince the guard that he is authorized to enter the building. The guard refuses him entry. The priest now picks up a rock and throws it at the guard, striking him and distracting him. The guard forgets everything that happened between the onset of the spell and the moment the rock struck.

    'effect': 'This spell allows the priest to create one specific form of insanity in the subject. Five forms of insanity are possible through this spell.\n&emsp;*Schizophrenia:* This form of insanity is characterized by personality loss. The subject has no personality of his own, so he selects a role model and makes every possible attempt to behave like that character. The chosen role model will be as different from the subject as possible. (Thus, an insane wizard might begin to follow the habits of a warrior.) Obviously, a warrior who believes himself to be a wizard will be unable to cast spells (he might *think* that he’s casting spells, or he might construct a sophisticated series of excuses explaining why he’s “not in the mood for magic” at the moment). A character who emulates a member of another class does not gain any of the skills of that class and makes all attacks and saving throws as appropriate to his true class. Certain consequences might arise if the character’s emulation causes him to break restrictions of his class. For example, a priest emulating a warrior might break his deity’s prohibition against edged weapons, or a paladin might emulate a Neutral Evil thief. Both will suffer the appropriate consequences as if they had been compelled to violate their beliefs while *charmed*. Such characters will certainly have to atone for their actions once they return to normal.\n&emsp;*Dementia praecox:* The subject is totally uninterested in any undertaking. Nothing seems worthwhile, and the individual is lethargic and filled with tremendous feelings of boredom and dissatisfaction. No matter how important the situation, it is 50% likely that the subject will ignore it as meaningless.\n&emsp;*Delusional insanity:* The subject is convinced that he is a famous figure: a monarch, demi-god, or similar personage. Characters who fail to recognize the subject with the honor he deserves incur great hostility or disbelief. The subject acts appropriately to a station that he does not hold. He directs orders at real and imaginary creatures and draws upon resources that do not exist.\n&emsp;*Paranoia:* The subject is convinced that “they” (whoever *they* are) are spying on him and plotting against him. Everyone around the subject, even friends and allies, is part of the plot. If any other character acts in a way that the subject can interpret as reinforcing this delusion, the subject has a 20% chance of reacting with violence.\n&emsp;*Hallucinatory insanity:* The subject sees, hears, and otherwise senses things that do not exist. The more stressful the situation is to the subject, the more likely he will hallucinate. Although most hallucinations are external to the subject (that is, he perceives creatures, objects, and conditions that do not exist), there is a 10% chance that any hallucination will involve the subject’s self-perception. For example, the subject might suddenly believe and act as if he had sprouted wings, grown to giant size, etc.\n&emsp;When this spell is cast by a priest of 13th level or lower, the DM chooses or randomly selects one of these forms of insanity (and should feel free to invent other interesting symptoms). If the priest is 14th level or higher, he can personally select the form of insanity to afflict the subject.\n&emsp;While under the effect of this spell, the subject can cast spells and use innate powers; the use of these abilities will be in accordance with the symptoms of the insanity, however. Player characters affected by this spell should be encouraged to role-play the appropriate effects to the limit.\n&emsp;The duration of this spell depends on the sum of the subject’s Intelligence and Wisdom scores. A saving throw is allowed on a periodic basis depending on this total. The spell is broken if a successful saving throw is rolled. Refer to the table that follows.}}{{style=center}}{{cc1-1=bottom}}{{c1-1=**Int + Wis**}}{{c2-1=8 or less}}{{c3-1=9 to 18}}{{c4-1=19 to 24}}{{c5-1=25 to 30}}{{c6-1=31 to 35}}{{c7-1=36 or more}}{{c1-2=**Time Between Checks**}}{{c2-2=1 month}}{{c3-2=3 weeks}}{{c4-2=2 weeks}}{{c5-2=1 week}}{{c6-2=3 days}}{{c7-2=1 day}}{{effects2=&emsp;The effects of this spell can be removed by a *limited wish*, *wish* (or equally powerful magic), or by a *heal* spell cast for this specific purpose.'

As long as the victim of the first arrow is within range, the subject affected by *repeat action* will adjust his aim and fire the second arrow at him. If the victim of the arrow moves out of range, the subject will fire his second arrow in the direction of the recipient. If the recipient is out of sight, the subject will fire in the direction of the recipient’s original location.\n&emsp;The subject of a *repeat action* spell must be capable of performing the indicated action a second time. If a character has no arrows in his quiver, he cannot fire an arrow. If a wizard were ordered to repeat a spell, he would attempt the spell only if he had the spell memorized and had sufficient material components. If a subject discovered a gem during a given round, *repeat action* will only compel him to hunt again; he will not recover another gem unless a second gem is actually present.\n&emsp;An unwilling subject is allowed a saving throw vs. spell to resist the effects of *repeat action*.'

The spell instantly generates a powerful mental impulse indicative of the caster’s general mental state—anger, fear, pain, despair, etc.\n&emsp;The caster can designate as many as ten persons to receive this message, provided they can all be specifically named or grouped in a general category. Thus, the caster could designate a group of characters by name or could target “fellow priests,” “superiors,” “adventuring companions,” “knights of Lord Harcourt,” or “villagers of Dopp.” If more than ten individuals are in the group, those closest to the source will receive the impulse.\n&emsp;There is no range limitation to the spell, although it cannot be projected outside the plane occupied by the caster.\n&emsp;Creatures receiving the impulse automatically know who sent it (even if they have never met the priest before) and gain a clear indication of the mood and situation of the caster. Recipients also intuitively know the general source of the spell, although they are unable to pinpoint rooms, dungeon levels, or landmarks. For example, a fighter could suddenly be struck by an image of Father Rastibon, who is injured and in great pain somewhere along the forest road. A priest might suddenly sense that his patriarch is being tortured in the dungeons of Castle Varrack.\n&emsp;The spell can also be cast by more than one priest, allowing them to either contact greater numbers of individuals or increase the intensity of the message. If greater numbers are desired, ten characters are contacted per priest involved in the casting.\n&emsp;Increasing the intensity of the message makes it more compelling. Doubling the intensity (requiring at least three priests) causes the message to act as a *suggestion*. In this case, the effect is limited to a single target.

If the creatures attack, the caster receives no Dexterity bonus to armor class (since this bonus represents dodging, and the priest is unable to dodge a creature that does not exist for him).\n&emsp;The caster can attempt to disbelieve as many as four creatures within 60 feet of his position at the time of casting. He disbelieves the same four creatures for the duration of the spell. Alternatively, the priest can disbelieve any or all inanimate objects of up to 20-cubic-yard volume (thus, he may disbelieve a 12 foot by 15 foot area of 3-foot-thick wall). This volume must be centered on a point no more than 20 yards from the caster. These two options are mutually exclusive; the priest can disbelieve only creatures *or* objects, not a combination of both.\n&emsp;Disbelieving a creature includes all gear, equipment, or treasure carried or worn by that creature; it does not include other objects that come into contact with that creature, such as walls, doors, chairs, etc.\n&emsp;*Disbelief* is not automatic; it requires an extreme effort. To successfully disbelieve, the priest must make a saving throw vs. paralyzation. A *successful* save means the priest has disbelieved; an *unsuccessful* check means that the spell has failed and the priest has not convinced himself of the creatures’ or objects’ non-existence.\n&emsp;While this spell is in effect, the DM must record any damage suffered by the priest from disbelieved creatures. When the spell ends, the caster makes a saving throw vs. spell. If the saving throw is successful, the priest suffers only one-eighth of any damage inflicted by the creatures (round all fractions down); if the priest fails the saving throw, he suffers one-half of any damage inflicted (round fractions down).'

The priest can effectively turn a flat plain into a slope of any direction, or may flatten an existing slope. The spell does not allow the priest to alter the pull of gravity, however.\n&emsp;This spell lets the priest create or negate a height differential of as much as 20 feet (a 2” slope in BATTLESYSTEM rules measurements) within the area of effect. This can have various consequences; the best way to discuss the effects is by example.\n&emsp;**Example 1:** Two units face each other on a flat plain. The priest can alter the slope of the terrain so that one unit is 2” of elevation higher than the other. The unit that is upslope gains the combat benefits for higher ground, and the unit that is downslope must pay the movement cost for moving uphill if it wishes to approach the other unit.\n&emsp;**Example 2:** One unit is on flat terrain; another unit, 6” away, is on a hill of 2” elevation. Using this spell, the priest can effectively eliminate this difference in elevation (raising the low ground or lowering the high ground). All combat and movement involving these two units is then conducted as if there were no elevation difference (i.e., no movement penalty, no combat benefit for higher ground, etc.). Alternatively, the priest could *increase* the height differential by 2”. Combat and movement would now be conducted as if the total difference in elevation were 4”.\n&emsp;**Example 3:** A unit faces a hill of 3” elevation. The priest casts *gravity variation*, decreasing the effective elevation of the hill to 1”. The unit pays a lower movement point cost to climb the hill. Alternatively, if the unit facing the hill were an enemy unit, the priest could increase the effective elevation to 5”.\n\n&emsp;The priest must specify the degree and direction of change at the moment of casting. These parameters cannot be changed while the spell remains in effect.\n&emsp;*Gravity variation* can have dramatic effects on siege engines and towers. Most siege engines can be moved only on the most gentle of slopes. By raising or lowering the effective elevation of siege engines by 2”, the priest can totally immobilize them by positioning them on a slope too steep to negotiate. In the case of siege towers, there is a 50% chance that the structures will topple over (totally destroying them).'

Because of the nature of this spell and its casting time, it is often used to cleanse grounds in preparation for the construction of a temple or sanctuary.\n&emsp;When casting *the great circle*, the priests stand in a circle of no more than 20-foot diameter. Each faces inward; when the spell is completed, each priest faces outward, directing the energy of the spell.\n&emsp;When the casting is complete, the spell takes the form of a radiant halo of golden light 20 feet above the ground. This halo quickly expands in a shimmering wave. It can pass through objects, with small arcs of the halo disappearing momentarily and reappearing on the far side. As the halo moves, it generates a high-pitched hum that varies in pitch, almost like a chorus. The halo moves slowly at first, but builds speed, reaching its maximum range at the end of one round.\n&emsp;The radius of the golden halo is dependent on the number of priests casting the spell. Each priest adds 60 feet to the radius. Thus, four priests could generate a halo that extends 240 feet in all directions from the circle of priests. Theoretically, there is no limit to the number of priests who may contribute to this spell, but the need for the priests to be within a 20-foot diameter circle sets a practical limit of 20 casters.\n&emsp;The halo is pure energy tapped from the Positive Material plane. It causes harm to undead and evil beings within the area of effect. Undead creatures of 8 or fewer hit dice are instantly destroyed and are not allowed a saving throw to avoid the effect. More powerful undead suffer 1d8 points of damage per caster. A successful saving throw vs. death magic reduces this damage to half. Creatures of evil alignment suffer 1d6 points of damage per caster (a saving throw is allowed for half-damage).\n&emsp;The reverse of this spell, *the black circle*, creates a ring of shimmering black energy. Paladins and priests of good alignment suffer 1d10 points of damage per priest in the circle. All other good creatures suffer 1d4 points of damage per caster. Affected creatures are allowed a saving throw vs. death magic to reduce the damage to one-half.'

Each priest contributes 10 feet to the radius of the spell. Six casters would create a spell with a radius of 60 feet. No more than twelve casters can cooperate to cast this spell (maximum of 22d6 damage and a 120-foot radius area of effect). This converts to an 8-inch circle in the BATTLESYSTEM rules ground scale.\n&emsp;The spell is difficult to cast, physically taxing the spellcasters so much that each caster suffers 3d10 points of damage from the effort. There is no saving throw allowed to avoid this damage.'

The illusory wall must be continuous (it cannot form two or more shorter walls), but it can follow any corners or bends that the caster desires.\n&emsp;In addition to the wall, the spell creates the illusion of constant movement among the crenellations, as if defending troops were moving atop the wall. The formation of the crenellations makes it impossible for a distant observer to determine exactly how many and what types of defenders are present on the *illusory fortification*.\n&emsp;The illusory wall remains in existence for [[2d12]] hours unless the spell is terminated earlier.\n&emsp;The spell has one very significant limitation: it is strictly two-dimensional and is visible from only one side (the side that the caster deems to be the “outside”). When viewed from the outside, the wall appears real; when viewed from the end, from above, or from the “inside,” the wall is totally invisible except for a faint outline of the shape of the wall. This means that friendly troops, concealed from enemy view by the illusory wall, can see their opponents clearly. The wall is most effective if friendly troops are informed of the wall’s presence and are careful not to walk through the illusion. Such an occurrence does not end the spell, but it will probably advise the enemy of the nature of the wall.\n&emsp;Spells cast at the wall and shots fired at the *illusory fortification* by siege engines appear to strike the wall and inflict normal damage. In reality, the missiles or spells pass through the illusion, possibly striking troops or real fortifications beyond. Such “hits” do not disturb the illusion.\n&emsp;As soon as an enemy unit moves within 10 yards of the *illusory fortification*, the spell terminates and the wall vanishes.\n&emsp;There are two ways in which the spell can be terminated before it expires. First, the priest can terminate the spell at any time. Second, if a friendly unit makes an attack, whether melee or missile combat, through the illusory wall from the “inside” to the “outside,” the spell terminates instantly.\n&emsp;Once the *illusory fortification* has been created, the priest does not need to concentrate on the wall.

It is called into existence when the first portion of this spell is cast.\n&emsp;When seen (which is seldom), the mind tracker has an indistinct body. It seems to be a near-solid coalescence of the vaporous atmosphere of the Ethereal plane itself. It is a roughly elliptical body with three or more limbs protruding at seemingly random locations. The number and size of these appendages shifts slowly, however, as new ones appear from the mist and old ones disappear. The body of the creature averages 2 feet across and 3 feet long, though this, too, tends to vary from minute to minute. The mind tracker has no discernible eyes, ears, nose, or other organs. It cannot be engaged in combat; if attacked, it simply disappears, to reappear after the danger has passed, or somewhere else entirely if its quarry has moved on.\n&emsp;The ceremony which creates the mind tracker takes one turn to perform.\n&emsp;Once the tracker is manifested, it must be assigned a quarry within one hour. If no quarry is designated, the tracker dissipates and the spell is wasted.\n&emsp;To assign a quarry to the tracker, the priest must have the quarry within his sight. This includes magical sight such as true seeing, but not remote sighting devices such as crystal balls. With the quarry in sight, the priest mouths the final phrases of the spell. From that point on, the mind tracker is mentally tethered to the victim. It follows its quarry (staying always in the Ethereal plane) wherever it goes. It constantly relays information about the subject to the priest: what it is doing, where it is. The priest does not actually see an image of the quarry, he receives ‘reports’ from the mind tracker. These reports contain only such information as the tracker can gather by looking. It cannot identify people the quarry is talking to, but can describe them in great detail. Nor can it hear anything the quarry or anyone else says, or read writing, but it recognizes and can report the fact that speaking or reading is happening.\n&emsp;While the tracker is dogging its quarry, its presence can be felt as an eery, creepy sensation of being watched. If the victim makes an initial save vs. paralyzation, each of the following stages lasts three hours instead of two. For the first two hours, the quarry has a general feeling of ill ease. In the third and fourth hours, the victim is distracted and nervous, and suffers a -1 penalty on all saving throws. In the fifth and sixth hours, the victim is convinced someone or something is following him and suffers a -3 penalty on saving throws and a -2 (or -10%) penalty on all other dice rolls. After six hours the victim is near his breaking point. He is unable to concentrate to cast spells or use any of his class’s special abilities. All die rolls have a -5 (or -25%) penalty. After eight hours, he must make a saving throw vs. paralyzation. If he fails, he collapses, fevered and delirious. This state persists until the tracker ceases to exist.\n&emsp;The mind tracker continues to exist for as long as the priest remains conscious of its input. If the priest is knocked out or falls asleep, or simply dismisses his creation, the tracker dissipates.'

The *spacewarp* spell creates a temporary but very intense warping in a limited area.\n&emsp;When the priest casts this spell, he selects a specific point to be the center of effect. This point may be anywhere within 50 yards of the caster, including in midair.\n&emsp;When the spell is completed, this center of effect gains a gravity field equal to the force felt at the surface of the earth. In other words, gravity is centered at this point; everything within 50 feet of this center that is not attached to something immovable will fall toward the selected point.\n&emsp;This localized gravity affects only loose objects and creatures capable of movement (i.e., not trees, whose roots are buried in the ground). It does not affect the ground itself—soil, plants, desert sand, lake water, etc. are immune to the effect.\n&emsp;An object falling toward the center of gravity gains speed exactly as it would if it were falling toward the ground. When the object reaches the center, it instantly ceases its movement. If objects are already at the center, newly arriving objects will slam into them, causing normal falling damage (1d6 per 10 feet) to the newly arriving objects. Objects previously at the center must save vs. paralyzation or suffer half that amount of damage.\n&emsp;Consider the following example. An orc is 10 feet away from the center of effect when the spell is cast. He falls 10 feet to the center and stops. His companion, a bandit, is 30 feet from the center. It takes him longer to fall to the center, so the orc is already there when he arrives, and the two characters collide forcefully. The bandit suffers 3d6 hit points of damage—the falling damage associated with a 30-foot fall. The orc must save vs. paralyzation or suffer half that amount.\n&emsp;Other things are caught in the effect as well. The bandit’s horse was 50 feet away from the center of effect, so it arrives at the center after the orc and the bandit. It falls 50 feet, suffering 5d6 points of damage, and potentially inflicting half that amount on both the orc and the bandit.\n&emsp;The center of effect can be anywhere within 50 yards of the priest. Possibly one of the most destructive uses of this spell is to cast it directly on an enemy creature. Everyone and everything within 50 feet of that creature falls toward him and strikes him, inflicting damage.\n&emsp;When the spell terminates, gravity returns to normal.

All six must touch hands at the time of casting. At the completion of the spell, the priests fall into a trance. The life essences of the priests leave their bodies and merge at a point within 10 feet of the casters. The spirits of the priests meld together to form the avatar of the priests’ deity.\n&emsp;In this manner, the six characters become a single being with all the powers and abilities allowed to that avatar. The only stipulation is that the priests’ deity cannot have created all avatars allowed to it at that moment. If this has happened, the spell fails and the priests are drained as described below.\n&emsp;If the spell succeeds, the priests have completely given their wills over to their deity, essentially forming the vessel into which it funnels power. In becoming the avatar, the priests retain the ability to make most of their own decisions. (The six must work in harmony or allow one of their number to decide all actions.) However, the deity can assume direct control of the avatar at any time it desires—the avatar is, after all, an earthly manifestation of the deity.\n&emsp;Although the spell has a duration of one hour, the deity is not obliged to release the priests at that time. If the priests are not released at the end of the spell’s duration, they instantly die. A deity can choose to sacrifice its priests in order to maintain its avatar on the Prime Material plane. Such a cruel and unjust action is almost never undertaken by good deities or those that have any respect for life, free will, or mercy. For dark and sinister gods, the question is much more uncertain. If a deity chooses to maintain the avatar longer than one hour, control of the avatar instantly and permanently passes to the DM. (Clearly, a DM should seldom if ever exercise this power.)\n&emsp;While the priests are formed into the avatar, their bodies remain in a death like trance. The priests have no idea what might be happening to their real bodies (unless the avatar can observe them). Any damage to a priest’s body requires an instant system shock roll. If successful, the damage is recorded normally, but the damage does not take effect until the spell ends (at which point the priest will almost certainly die). If the system shock roll is failed, the character instantly dies and the spell ends. Characters who die in this manner cannot be raised, resurrected, or reincarnated. They have been taken to the ultimate reward (or punishment) for the service they have rendered. If the bodies are moved from their positions, the spell ends.\n&emsp;Even if the deity releases the priests, they are left severely drained. All spells memorized are lost until the priest can rest and perform his prayers once again. The physical drain leaves each priest with only 1 hit point upon awakening, regardless of the number of hit points the character had when the spell was cast. Since damage suffered during the spell takes effect instantly, any priest who is hurt dies immediately (although quick action by others might save him).\n&emsp;Each priest who survives the spell will be bound by a quest (a duty that must be completed in exchange for calling upon their god).'

Once the weather has arrived, it cannot be dispelled. If the spell is canceled by the caster before the beginning of the fifth turn, the weather slowly reverts to its original condition.\n&emsp;The effects of the spell are the decision of the DM. The effects should be grand and impressive. Following are suggested effects of the weather.\n&emsp;*Torrential Rain/Blizzard:* Visibility is reduced to 100 yards or less; travel is nearly impossible due to water or heavy snow on the ground.\n&emsp;*Storm/Hurricanes:* All flying creatures are driven from the skies; trees are uprooted; roofs are torn off; ships are endangered.\n&emsp;*Heat Wave:* Intense heat immediately causes ice bridges to melt; avalanches of snow and ice roll down mountains.\n&emsp;The DM determines the area of effect randomly. The maximum duration of the spell is one turn per level of the caster; however, the DM may cancel the effect after a shorter time.'

First, a *prayer* spell is continuously operative in the area of effect, shifting the balance of combat probabilities toward the favor of the priest who casts this spell and his companions. Second, probabilities of exactly 50% always shift in favor of the spellcasting priest. For example, if a roll of 11 or better is needed to save against a spell effect, this is a 50% chance for success. In such cases, the priest and his friends always make the save and enemies always fail.\n&emsp;This spell is particularly potent if *bless* and *chant* spells are cast in the area of effect.'

The spell’s duration begins after all affected creatures have been linked. Characters of any class may take part in this linkage, benefiting from several effects.\n&emsp;First, each member of the *mindnet* benefits from Intelligence, Wisdom, and Dexterity bonuses. The bonuses are equal to the bonuses held by the member of the *mindnet* with the highest ability score. For example, if five creatures in a *mindnet* have Wisdom scores of 15, 15, 16, 17, and 18, each creature would make saving throws, ability checks, and the like as if he had a Wisdom score of 18. Bonus spells are not gained due to enhanced Wisdom, however.\n&emsp;Second, spells may be pooled among the spellcasters within the *mindnet*. Any priest may use a spell memorized by another priest with two conditions: the priest who has memorized the spell must allow its use; and a priest “borrowing” a spell may use only spells of levels he could normally cast. Such borrowing still causes the spell to be lost from the mind of the caster who memorized it. A caster may *not* borrow spells outside his normal class restrictions. Priests and wizards within a *mindnet* cannot mix their priestly and wizardly spells, nor can a specialist borrow a spell from an opposition school.\n&emsp;Third, each member of the *mindnet* is in constant mental communication. Each member knows what is happening at the locations of all other members.\n&emsp;Finally, twice per turn, the priest casting this spell can instantly teleport any person linked by the *mindnet* to any other person who is also a part of the spell. This massive effort results in a +4 penalty to any Constitution checks made by the priest.\n&emsp;The priest casting the spell cannot perform any other actions while the *mindnet* exists; if he does, the spell is canceled.

The Power granting the spell causes the spell’s effects to manifest in one of two ways: the Chaos variation or the Thought variation.\n&emsp;In the Chaos variation, the fabric of reality is altered to change events.

Magical items dysfunction because the thoughts of their users are warped to either convince them that the items cannot function or block thought so that proper commands cannot be given.\n&emsp;The effects on the victims of the spell are the same for both variations. Each round, there is a 50% chance that a degeneration effect will occur in the area of effect. When this occurs, two events take place. First, spellcasters lose one spell from each level of spell currently memorized (e.g., a spellcaster who has memorized three spells each from levels 1 through 3 loses one spell from each level for a total of three). Lost spells may be regained normally through rest and memorization.\n&emsp;Second, magical items are affected in the following ways:\n&emsp;• Weapons and armor lose one level of enchantment (a *sword +3* becomes a *sword +2*, etc.).\n&emsp;• Magical items that carry charges (wands, rods, staves, etc.) are drained of 1d10 charges.\n&emsp;• Magical items without pluses or charges must make a saving throw versus spell (using the saving throw of their owner) or become nonmagical.\n&emsp;• Potions lose all magic and scrolls lose one randomly determined spell.\n&emsp;• Permanent magical items (swords, boots, armor, etc.) temporarily lose all effects until the spell expires or until the items leave the area of effect and for 1d10 rounds thereafter.\n\n&emsp;Single-use and charged items are permanently affected by this spell. A potion destroyed by this spell remains useless even after the spell ends.\n&emsp;Within the area of effect, magical communication is impossible due to thought blocks and chaotic effects. No communication magic (*ESP*, *sending*, etc.) will function; any spellcaster trying to cast such a spell will be stunned for 1 round per level of the spell he attempts to cast. A reverse of the *tongues* spell operates continuously in the area of effect. Telepathic communication (e.g., with a familiar) is also impossible.\n&emsp;In the Chaos variation of the spell, the center of the area of effect moves 10’ per round. The direction is randomly determined using 1d8 roll and compass points (1 = N, 2 = NE, 3 = E, 4 = SE, 5 = S, 6 = SW, 7 = W, 8 = NW).

Casting this spell joins the life force of the druid with that of the tree; as long as the tree lives, the caster ages at one-tenth the normal rate. (Because the spell causes the tree to devote all its energy to maintaining health rather than growth, it always remains exactly the size it was at the time of casting.) Moreover, the caster’s spirit merges with the tree at the character’s death. No form of reincarnation or resurrection (except a *wish*) on the character’s body will work unless it lies within 10 feet of the tree.\n&emsp;One year after the caster dies, the druid’s spirit animates the tree as a treant. (DMs should roll up treant statistics for the tree at the time the spell is cast, to determine the tree’s Armor Class, Hit Dice, etc.) The chosen tree must be of treant height; the exact size determines the size of the new treant, which possesses the caster’s memories and personality but has no granted powers or spellcasting ability. It must communicate as a treant.\n&emsp;The DM decides whether to consider this treant an NPC or allow the player to control it. (DMs should use the guidelines that apply to PCs who become lycanthropes or undead.)\n&emsp;However, when a druid uses *tree spirit* to link with a tree, the character suffers any physical damage inflicted on the tree. For instance, if someone hacks at the tree with an axe and causes 4 points of damage, the caster also loses 4 hit points; the druid knows the tree has been harmed, but does not know the nature of the injury.\n&emsp;If the tree dies but does not sustain enough damage to kill the caster, the character feels stunned for 1d6 rounds and must make a successful system shock roll to avoid death. Spells that heal the druid do not affect the tree.\n&emsp;Damage to the caster does not affect the tree, as the extra energy the tree expends on strength and health makes any damage the player sustains negligible to the tree. However, it’s usually in the druid’s best interest to have an animal friend or two guard the tree.\n&emsp;In addition, the druid should choose the tree carefully; if the surrounding land is cleared for construction work or lumber before the druid’s prolonged life span finally ends, the character is in trouble.\n&emsp;Casting *tree spirit* first requires a full month’s preparation. The druid lives near the tree during this time of prayer and mediation. Then the character conducts a private bonding ceremony at the height of a solstice.

If successful, the *spirit bound* corpse takes on a pale silvery or mauve radiance. Normal animals and even monsters of low intelligence will involuntarily shun this necromantic aura.\n&emsp;While under the effect of this spell, a cadaver becomes immune to the normal effects of rot and decay. *Spirit bind* may thus be employed to preserve a body for a subsequent *raising* or *resurrection*, for which the spirit bound individual is considered to have been dead for less than a day. Furthermore, because of the strong, necromantic link already forged between the spirit and the body, the victim receives a –10% bonus on his or her system shock roll.\n&emsp;However, this spell is more often put to much darker ends by death priests. Note that, for the deceased, being *spirit bound* is not a pleasant experience. The spirit may not be aware of its current location or the passage of time (or so good-aligned priests who employ this spell may like to think), but it is most certainly aware of being trapped or constrained. Once *bound* to its body, a spirit is much easier to coerce with threats of permanent imprisonment and to interrogate with *speak with dead* spells. Some sages speculate *spirit bind* may be also involved in the loathsome creation of a flesh golem.\n&emsp;While immune to normal decay and dissolution (and the ravaging of animals and dumb monsters), the *spirit bound* corpse is in no way protected from destruction by a sentient creature or individual. Should its body be destroyed, the spirit instead becomes *bound* to the last area resided by the physical remains. Such a restless, quasi-liberated spirit might become a non-corporeal undead (such as an apparition, banshee, haunt, poltergeist, wraith, ghost, or spectre). A spirit imprisoned in this manner may only be released by casting the reverse of this spell (see below) or *dispel evil* (*dispel magic* and *reverse curse* are ineffective). Because of the considerable dangers for the subject and moral quandaries involved, good-aligned priests are naturally reluctant to employ *spirit bind* except in the most dire emergencies.\n&emsp;The reverse of this spell, *spirit release*, severs a spirit’s ties with the material world and is a common practice at formal funerals. Unwilling, non-corporeal undead are entitled to a saving throw to resist the spell’s effects, subject to the same penalties as outlined for *spirit bind*. If failed, the undead spirit departs for the outer planes and is effectively dispersed. Note that neither version of this spell affects corporeal undead (such as ghouls, liches, and vampires), nor do they affect extraplanar creatures.'

The spell must be administered while the patient is exhibiting insane symptoms. *Cure insanity* can heal a conscious victim of the effects of hallucinatory spores and repair psychic trauma (resulting from a mindwipe or other psionic assault). The spell also diminishes psychic exhaustion (restoring 5–40 PSPs). It cures madness resulting from spells (such as *confusion*, *chaos*, *contact other plane*, *feeblemind*, *symbol of insanity*, and *prismatic spray*, *wall*, or *sphere*) and also heals the insanity caused by certain magical items (such as an *elixir of madness* or a *scarab of insanity*). However, the spell will not control aberrant behaviors caused by lycanthropy, undeath, or powerful curses (such as a *geas* or *quest*).

This saving throw is modified according to the victim’s hit point adjustment due to Constitution (+1 bonus for 15 Con, +2 for 16 Con, and so on; see page 21 in the *PHB* for more on this).\n&emsp;If the victim makes this first saving throw, the spell fails to take hold of his or her heart and has no further effect. If the victim fails the save, however, then he or she suffers a massive spasm of pain in the chest (similar to that felt in a heart attack), inflicting 1–8 points of damage on the victim and completely incapacitating the individual for one excruciating round.\n&emsp;During the second round, the victim is entitled to another saving throw, this time with a –1 penalty (plus any bonuses for Con). As before, if the victim makes the save, the spell ends with no further effect. If failed, however, the victim’s chest pain intensifies, as if a searing band of iron were being slowly tightened around the heart. The character experiences severe dizziness, disorientation, and terrible shooting pains in the arms, jaw, and left shoulder.\n&emsp;Meanwhile, the victim loses 25% of any remaining hit points, is paralyzed with pain for 2–5 rounds, and immediately loses 2–5 points of Strength, Constitution, and Dexterity. Providing the victim survives the final stage of the spell (see below), these lost points are regained at a rate of 1 point in each these three ability scores per day.\n&emsp;On the third round of the spell, the target must make a (third, unmodified) saving throw vs. death magic or suffer a massive heart attack, resulting in immediate death (onset time is 1 round, during which time, the victim is completely incapacitated). Alternatively, a kind DM might decide that the final phase of the spell merely plunges the victim into a deep, death-like coma, lasting 1–4 days and resulting in the permanent loss of 1 point of Constitution.\n&emsp;This deadly spell may be thwarted in a number of ways. Successfully casting *dispel magic* on either the victim or the priest will disrupt the *heart blight*, as will casting a simple *protection from evil* spell on the victim or wearing a *scarab of protection* (this drains a charge, however). Furthermore, the victim may be entitled to repeat a saving throw with a +2 bonus if treated by another character with the healing non-weapon proficiency. Finally, the spell is immediately broken if the victim is transported out of range or removed from the priest’s line of sight.

If failed, the victim suffers 1–6 points of damage. If successful, the subject manages to gasp in enough air to reduce the damage to 1–3 points. During its struggles against *asphyxiation*, the affected creature becomes effectively *slowed* (as per the 3rd-level wizard spell). A victim who fails three consecutive Constitution checks has been smothered and dies automatically on the following round.\n&emsp;The effects of *asphyxiate* continue until either the spell expires, a victim withdraws beyond range of the spell, or a successful *dispel magic* is employed on a victim. Victims remain *slowed* for 1–3 rounds after the spell ends.

Obviously, creatures (such as undead and plant creatures) that never breathe cannot be affected by this spell.\n&emsp;Because of its murderous effect, *asphyxiate* is typically granted only to priests serving evil deities.'

The *pact* may be established to benefit an individual other than the caster. However, in almost all cases, the chosen one must be in good standing with the caster’s religion and agree to undertake a mission that will directly benefit the deity or dark power responsible for granting the spell. A *dispel magic* cannot end a *death pact* prematurely.\n&emsp;This powerful spell is not without its costs, however. Forging a *death pact* is an exhaustively stressful process, drawing the priest into draining audiences with extraplanar powers. As a result, establishing a *death pact* ages the caster five years and requires at least one week for complete recuperation, during which time the priest cannot cast any spells or engage in any physically demanding activity. Furthermore, when the pact is invoked, the mystical transport and instantaneous healing exacts another toll, this time aging the recipient for five years (if the individual was *raised*, he or she also loses one point of Constitution permanently). Thus, if the priest casts the spell on him- or herself, he or she must be prepared to sacrifice at least ten years of life!\n&emsp;This powerful pact has enabled many “slain” priests to return from the dead and eliminate their enemies. Wicked necromancers in the service of evil deities are rumored to have significantly reduced the terrible personal toll on the caster by some unspeakably foul sacrifice. Note that powerful wizard necromancers might achieve a similar effect with *wish*-fortified *contingency* spells.'

    'effect': 'Originally developed by the Harmonium faction of the Outer Planes, this useful spell has come into more widespread use in recent years. While the spell is available as a 2nd-level enchantment for members of the Harmonium, the general version is not quite as efficient and is considered a 3rd-level spell.\n&emsp;The *dictate* spell is an improved version of *command*, affecting up to 6 creatures in a 20-foot cube. The caster is not limited to a single word and can issue an order of no more than a dozen words in length. All the specified targets who fail their saving throws must attempt to obey the caster’s instructions. For example, a priest could issue a *dictate* such as “Stay here until I return,” “Throw down your weapons,” or “Seize that elf!” The subjects will continue to obey nonimmediate orders for up to one round per experience level of the caster.\n&emsp;Subjects who cannot understand the caster are not affected, so characters who do not understand the caster’s language are immune to this spell. In addition, the order must create an immediate and obvious course of action for the subject; a *dictate* to “Die!” or “Feel sorry for him!” would simply cause the subject to stand still in *confusion* for one round. Poorly worded or confusing commands grant the subjects a +1 to +4 bonus on their saving throws at the DM’s discretion. Similarly, if after the subject fails his saving throw he is given an obviously self-destructive *dictate*, the subject simply loses his next round as he fights off the compulsion.'

First, the priest may not leave the Border Ethereal and venture into the Deep Ethereal; therefore, at the end of the spell’s duration, he must return to the Prime Material Plane whether he wants to or not. Secondly, the priest may not use this spell on an unwilling target and can only make another creature ethereal if the subject is willing and in physical contact with the priest when the spell is cast. Besides himself, the caster can bring one creature per two experience levels (three at 5th, four at 7th, five at 9th, and so on) to the Ethereal Plane. Currently [[ceil([[@{level-priest}]]/2)]] creatures. Even if the priest abandons his charges in the Border Ethereal, the stranded characters will automatically materialize when the spell ends.\n&emsp;While *ethereal*, the priest cannot be detected by any means short of a *true seeing* or *detect phase* spell. He perceives his surroundings as misty, gray, and otherworldly. No action he takes can affect the physical world, but he can pass through walls, doors, and other solid objects without hindrance. The priest can choose to end the spell voluntarily at any time, materializing in the physical world in one round. If the caster occupies a solid object when the spell ends, he is hurled into the Deep Ethereal and stranded in a catatonic stupor until he can be rescued.'

Clerics usually summon minor elementals of some kind, while shamans typically conjure an animal spirit or spirit of nature. Regardless of the spirit’s origin, it appears as a ghostly beast of some kind—wolves, bears, tigers, or lions are most common. The *animal spirit* obeys the mental commands of the priest, attacking his enemies or performing any other task that it could reasonably accomplish. The creature is incorporeal and cannot handle or manipulate objects of any kind, but it can see and hear as a normal animal of its archetype and could be used to scout a dangerous area or act as a distraction of some kind.\n&emsp;In combat, the *animal spirit* has the following statistics: MV 24; AC 4; THAC0 15; Dmg 2d4. It can only be injured by magical weapons and can strike monsters hit only by +1 or better weapons. The spirit has a number of hit points equal to 10 plus the caster’s level, so a 6th-level priest conjures a *animal spirit* with 16 hit points. Currently [[10+[[@{level-priest}]] ]] hit points. The creature is not affected by *charm*, *sleep*, *hold*, or other mind-affecting spells and suffers no damage from cold-based attacks. However, it is vulnerable to *dispel magic* or turning as an undead monster of the caster’s Hit Dice. If the *animal spirit* is turned, destroyed, or dispelled, the priest who summoned it must make a saving throw vs. spell or be stunned for 1d4 rounds.\n&emsp;Because the spirit is intelligent and free-willed under the caster’s direction, the priest need not concentrate in order to direct its attacks—an *animal spirit* could be ordered to attack a spellcaster in the back of an enemy party, while the cleric waded into hand-to-hand combat. The *animal spirit* makes use of flank or rear attacks when it can and gains any normal combat bonuses that a living creature in its position would be entitled to. The priest enjoys instantaneous, silent communication with the *animal spirit* and can order it to stop attacking, to change its target, or to undertake almost any conceivable action desired. However, the spirit must remain within the spell’s range; if it is ever more than 10 yards per caster level away from the priest, it dissipates harmlessly.'

However, each time a new *hold poison* is used to stop the venom’s advance for another few days, there is a 2% cumulative chance that the spell fails and the poison runs its course.

    'effect': '*Repair injury* is intended for use in campaigns featuring the critical hit or critical strike rules. This spell addresses one specific injury or wound (see Chapter 8). It can be used to knit a broken bone, alleviate the swelling and pain of a sprain or a twist, or repair soft-tissue damage such as an injured eye, ear, or a severed tendon. If used as a simple curing spell, *repair injury* restores 1d10+1 hit points to the injured character, but if used to address the effects of a specific injury, *repair injury* automatically removes one grazed, struck, injured, or broken condition, and alleviates any combat, movement, or maximum hit point penalties associated with the injury in question. The spell does not restore any lost hit points to the victim, other than the 1d10+1 that are incidental to the working of the spell.\n\n&emsp;*Beran, a fighter with 44 hit points, is struck by an ogre’s club. The blow inflicts 12 points of damage, but Beran also suffers a broken hip. This injury will reduce him to a maximum of 25% of his normal total, so Beran’s current hit points drop from 32 to 11 after the battle ends. In addition, he is not capable of moving or attacking due to the effects of the injury.\n&emsp;When the smoke clears, Talmos the priest comes to Beran’s aid. Using* repair injury, *he knits Beran’s broken hip. The spell cures 6 hit points in the process. Beran no longer suffers the movement or attack penalties for a broken hip and has 17 hit points to his credit. With time or additional healing, he can regain his normal total of 44.\n\n&emsp;*Repair injury* is also helpful in dealing with wounds that fall in the crushed, shattered, or destroyed category. This spell reduces the severity of the injury to the broken level, which means it heals as if it were 20d6 lost hit points. Only one *repair injury* can be used on any given wound, so a character with a shattered knee could still require a lot of time to recover after an application of this spell.\n&emsp;Severed limbs, destroyed eyes or ears, and ability score losses caused by injuries cannot be healed by this spell. *Repair injury* is the equivalent of *cure serious wounds* for the purpose of slowing or stopping bleeding.'

Similarly, opening a door that leads into the lair of a ferocious troll may also trigger the spell’s warning.

The *wind servant* can affect objects or creatures weighing up to 1 pound per caster level, twice as much if the object is reasonably light or airy (a cloak, scroll, or haystack, for instance), or 10 times as much if the object is designed to be carried by the wind, such as a ship’s sail or a bird in flight.\n&emsp;If an object is within the spell’s weight limit, the caster may direct the *wind servant* to carry it along in gusts and air currents at a flying movement rate of 12 (E). If the object leaves the limits of the spell’s range, the *wind servant* fails, and the object drops or falls normally from that point. Flying creatures of size M or smaller can be forced to land or be driven away by use of the spell if they fall within the weight limit, or slowed by 50% if they exceed the weight limit. Employing the *wind servant* against an arrow or light missile adds a penalty of –4 to the attack roll.\n&emsp;In dusty, snowy, or sandy regions, the caster can instead use *wind servant* to create a vicious zephyr of stinging dust around an enemy. This zephyr inflicts damage equal to the opponent’s base AC less 2d6 points and creates a –2 penalty to the victim’s attack rolls. For example, an enemy in *leather armor +1* (AC 7) would suffer 7 – 2d6 damage if attacked by means of this spell.

For example, a 7th-level priest has a 70% + 7% - 4%, or 73% chance, to spot a wizard concealing himself by using the 2nd-level spell *invisibility*.\n&emsp;Unlike the 5th-level spell *true seeing*, the *omniscient eye* does not grant the caster the ability to perceive secret doors, traps, lost or misplaced objects, or creature alignments; it simply ensures that the caster can see the surroundings as they would appear without the interference of weather, lighting, or illusionary magic. Thus, the *omniscient eye* can be deceived by careful camouflage, concealment, or other purely physical precautions. Other phenomena that may bypass this spell’s power include psionic invisibility, true transparency, or extradimensional objects or creatures.'

    'effect': 'By using this spell, the caster can place one willing subject in a state of *suspended animation*. The victim’s breathing, heartbeat, and other vital processes slow to the point of nonexistence, although he or she seems to be deeply a*sleep*, not dead. A caster of 7th to 10th level can maintain the *suspended animation* for up to one week plus one day per level (1 week + [[@{level-priest}]] days); a caster of 11th to 15th level can maintain the state for up to one month plus one week per level (1 month + [[@{level-priest}]] weeks); and a caster of 16th level or higher can place someone in *suspended animation* for one year plus one month per level (1 year + [[@{level-priest}]] months).\n&emsp;This spell has many useful applications. First, all bodily or mental afflictions become quiescent during the victim’s slumber. Poison, insanity, and many curses (lycanthropy, geas, and mummy rot included) can be arrested, if not cured, and have no effect on the subject while he sleeps. Of course, if the spell is broken prematurely, all the conditions that were halted by the spell will start once again. Second, the subject requires no food or water, but he still needs air and dies if deprived of oxygen. Third, for every month that the subject is in *suspended animation*, he recovers one hit point.\n&emsp;The caster can awaken the subject at any time within the spell’s duration, although he must be in the subject’s presence to do so. Optionally, the priest may pre-specify an amount of time within his normal duration or a special condition to awaken the sleeper. A condition must include a physical stimulus to the subject, such as a change in temperature, the touch of the sun, the kiss of a princess, or whatever the priest desires. If the priest maintaining the spell dies or is not able to awaken the sleeper, then the subject can be taken to another priest of the same deity to be awakened.\n&emsp;If the subject is attacked, he is completely helpless and can be killed by a single blow. However, if the subject is attacked without being slain for some reason, he gains a saving throw vs. spell each round to emerge from his *suspended animation*. The subject will be extremely groggy and disoriented if his slumber is disturbed in this fashion, suffering a –2 penalty to all die rolls for 1d6 turns, but if he awakens in the normal or prescribed fashion, he is disoriented for only one round.\n&emsp;Some of the drawbacks to this spell affect the casting priest. First of all, it takes all of the priest’s concentration to cast and maintain this spell. This means that the priest cannot cast any other spell while a subject is being held under the influence of the *suspended animation*. For each week that the subject is in *suspended animation*, the priest loses one point of Constitution. This happens each week until the priest transfers the spell to another priest of the same alignment. Transferring this spell requires a successful saving throw vs. spell. If the saving throw is successful, then the priest who transfers the spell can start recovering Constitution at a rate of one point per hour of bedrest. If the saving throw doesn’t succeed, then the priest loses another point of Constitution and cannot try to transfer the spell again for 8 hours. Either way, because of the temporary lapse of the spell, the subject will automatically lose 1 hit point each time a transfer is attempted.'

You control magical fires at level [[1d20-11+[[@{level-priest}]] ]] and below. For example, a 9th-level priest can animate a *flaming sphere* cast by a 4th level wizard on a roll of 6 or better on 1d20.

If the priest directs the flame to leave the spell’s range, the spell ends and the flame stops and burns whatever it may be resting on. *Animate flame* can be a very effective weapon; the fire attacks with a THAC0 of 10 and may be able to strike several creatures in the same round, depending on its size.

Very hot or unusually cold fires may inflict damage (at the DM’s discretion) as if they were one category larger or smaller. In addition to attacking the caster’s enemies, the fire will naturally cause any combustibles it comes into contact with to burn, as well; an animated fire can easily torch a small town, given a few rounds to move from building to building.\n&emsp;The animated flame can be dispelled normally. It can also be defeated by contact with a significant volume of water, ice, cold, or earth or dirt, just as a normal fire can be drowned or smothered.\n&emsp;The priest can affect a single fire of up to 1 foot in diameter per level of experience; if a natural fire is too large for him to animate, he can animate a smaller portion of it and command the portion he controls. Magical fires cannot be divided in this way, so it requires a very high-level priest to deflect the breath weapon of a red dragon!'

Until time catches up to him, he may move about unhindered and observe his surroundings; no force known can detect his presence or harm him in the alternate reality, although he in turn cannot affect any creature or object in the physical world. For instance, he could read a book at the page it was opened to, but he could not turn the page since that would require him to move an object that is temporarily immovable for him. To his companions or enemy in real time, the priest appears to simply vanish altogether, only to reappear at some later point.\n&emsp;The duration of this spell is a little odd, to say the least. The priest may choose a duration of up to 1 round at 7th to 9th level, 2 rounds at 10th to 12th level, 3 rounds at 13th to 16th, 4 rounds at 17th to 19th, up to a maximum of 5 rounds at 20th level or higher. Currently up to [[{ceil(([[@{level-priest}]]-6)/3),5}kl1]] round(s). The duration chosen by the priest governs the length of the *othertime*; if the priest decides that the spell will last 2 rounds, then he is instantly transported to that point in time, surrounded by the frozen still-life of the world as it will appear 2 rounds after the priest cast *othertime*. The caster then has 2 rounds to himself to take any actions he cares to, although he cannot affect the real world by any physical, magical, or mental means.\n&emsp;While the caster is in the *othertime*, he is completely unaware of the intervening events. In the example above, if the caster’s friends were *teleported* away 1 round after the caster left and replaced by an identical group of dopplegangers, the caster would have no chance to detect the switch; all he sees are the bodies of his “friends,” frozen in the positions they will occupy when he emerges from the *othertime*. This also means that nasty things like dragon breath, *cloudkill*s, or *mind blasts* that pass through the spot where the caster happens to be have no effect on him—he simply does not exist in the real world while he waits for everyone else to catch up to him.\n&emsp;As noted above, the caster gains an amount of subjective time equal to the duration of the spell. By leaping 3 rounds into the future, the caster gains 3 rounds of actions in the *othertime*. He could drink a potion, cast a spell, and then maneuver for an attack, for example, or he could gain a 3-round head start by running for his life while no one else can pursue him. If the priest uses this time to study a battle and position himself for an attack, he gains a –4 bonus to his initiative roll on the round he emerges from *othertime*, and a +4 attack bonus with his first strike.\n&emsp;Leaping in and out of the time stream is a dangerous activity; every time the priest employs this spell, there is a 1% noncumulative chance that he becomes stuck in *othertime*, doomed to death by thirst or starvation when his own rations run out. Only the most extraordinary measures (a *wish* spell, divine intervention, etc.) can save a character in this predicament. Once a priest is in *othertime*, he cannot pray for further spells. After all, if the priest is going to attract his deity’s attention by praying for spells, the deity will most likely allow him out!'

If this action places the subject in mortal peril, he may attempt a saving throw (whether he was originally entitled to one or not) in order to break free of the spell’s power. Therefore, ordering a character standing at the edge of a cliff to “jump” will create an opportunity for the subject to break free. A command to “die” or “sleep” renders the creature unconscious for the spell’s duration.\n&emsp;Undead creatures are immune to this spell.'

The *entropy shield* extends about two feet in all directions from the caster’s body. The warping effect of the field causes any melee or hand-to-hand attack to miss 50% of the time—even if the roll allows an attack to continue, the priest still gains a –2 bonus to his Armor Class. Normal missiles or hurled weapons miss automatically as the *entropy shield* deflects them from the caster. Even magical missile attacks (*produce flame*, *magic missile*, or *Melf’s acid arrow*, for example), siege engines, and giant-thrown boulders may be deflected as if they were hand-to-hand attacks.\n&emsp;Against spells or effects that produce energy, gas, or other physical attack forms (*fireball*, *lightning bolt*, *cloudkill*, and other such spells) the *entropy shield* provides a 50% chance that the attack simply does not affect the protected priest. Even if the harmful energy or matter penetrates the shield, the caster gains a +2 bonus on his saving throw. This does not cause a spell to fizzle or fail; a priest standing in the middle of a *fireball* is simply not touched by the spell, which will inflict its normal damage on anyone else in the area of effect. Any spell or effect that does not create matter or energy to harm or hinder the victim can pass through the *entropy shield* normally, so mind-based attacks and magical effects such as *petrification*, *paralyzation*, *enfeeblement*, or *polymorph* (to name a few) can still affect the priest.\n&emsp;In addition to its defensive benefits, the *entropy shield* has the ability to repel normal or giant-sized animals and creatures of lawful alignment, such as extraplanar monsters from the lawful planes. Any such creature attempting to attack the shielded priest in hand-to-hand combat must roll a saving throw vs. spell at the end of the round. If the creature fails, it recoils from the priest and cannot attack him physically for the remainder of the spell’s duration (although it could decide to turn on one of the priest’s companions).'

Size M (man-sized) or smaller creatures who fail their first saving throw must attempt a second one, or be picked up bodily by the *whirlwind* and held suspended in its powerful winds, suffering 1d8 points of damage each round with no save allowed.

    'effect': 'This mighty spell summons a tsunami, or gigantic wave, from any major body of water. The body of water must be at least 1 mile in width, so in most circumstances the *tsunami* can only be summoned from the sea, large lakes, or extremely big rivers. The wave is 2 feet high and 10 feet long for each level of experience of the caster, so a 15th-level priest would summon a *tsunami* 30 feet high and 150 feet wide. The wave can appear anywhere within the spell’s range and immediately sweeps forward in the direction specified by the caster. This may take it out of the allowed range or even back at the casting priest. The *tsunami* moves at a rate of 24 (240 yards per round) and lasts one round at 14th level, two rounds at 18th level, or three rounds at 22nd or higher level. Currently [[{ceil(([[@{level-priest}]]-13)/4),3}kl1]] rounds.\n&emsp;Ships caught by the *tsunami* must make a seaworthiness check (see Table 77: Ship Types in the *DMG*) with a penalty equal to the wave’s height in feet. For example, a *tsunami* created by a 15th-level caster would inflict a –30% penalty to a vessel’s seaworthiness check. If the check is failed, the vessel capsizes and sinks in 1d10 rounds, with the possible loss of those aboard. Human or humanoid swimmers caught in the wave must make a saving throw vs. death magic or be drowned in the wave; any creature in the water in the wave’s path will be carried along as long as it lasts.\n&emsp;If the priest sent the wave towards the shore, the *tsunami* loses 5 feet of height for every 20 yards it travels; a 30-foot wave could wash 120 yards inland before there was nothing left of it. Creatures caught in the area sustain 1d4 points of damage for every 5 feet of height the *tsunami* currently possesses and are carried along until it ends. Air-breathing creatures must make saving throws vs. death magic or be drowned outright by this treatment. Wooden buildings have a chance equal to three times the wave’s current height of being destroyed by the *tsunami* (90% for a 30-foot wave, for example) while stone buildings have a chance equal to the wave’s height (or 30% for a 30-foot wave). Topography may influence or channel the wave’s advance, so a good-sized hill could stop a *tsunami* cold, although its seaward face may be denuded of creatures and vegetation by the wave.\n&emsp;Note that this spell in the hands of a high-level character can blanket an awesome amount of territory and literally destroy or drown anything in its path. The *tsunami* is so strenuous a spell that the priest is exhausted and helpless for 1d6 hours after summoning it.'
