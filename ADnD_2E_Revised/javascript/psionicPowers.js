With each use of this power, the psionicist can learn only one piece of information—either the subject’s alignment or experience level, but not both simultaneously.\n&emsp;A psionicist can examine up to two auras per round (he must be able to see both subjects). Alternately, he can examine the same aura twice, to verify his first impression with a second reading or to pick up remaining information. In any case, the psionicist must make a new power check each time he attempts to interpret an aura.\n&emsp;The psionicist can be reasonably discreet when he uses this power. He doesn’t have to poke at the subject or give him the hairy eyeball. However, he does need to gaze at the subject intently. Since the range of this power is the range of vision, the psionicist can go unnoticed by maintaining his distance. If he tries to sense auras on the people he is conversing with, they certainly will notice that he is staring and probably will be uncomfortable.\n&emsp;The level of the character being analyzed affects the psionicist’s power check. The higher the subject’s experience level, the tougher it is to interpret the subject’s aura. This translates into a -1 penalty for every three levels of the subject, rounded down. For example, a psionicist reading the aura of an 8th level character would suffer a -2 penalty.\n&emsp;If the die roll for the power check is a 1, the psionicist’s reading is incomplete or slightly incorrect.

If the characters involved deviate from the actions the psionicist describes, then they are changing the conditions and the lines of time, thereby making other outcomes more likely. Die rolls (particularly for surprise, initiative, and normal combat) also play a large part in a precognition’s inaccuracy.

If the check succeeds, the character knows which way he came. If the roll fails, he isn’t sure. (He can still maintain the power normally, however.)\n&emsp;Radial navigation can be helpful in several ways that are not obvious. For example, teleportation and other extraordinary means of travel become simpler. Let’s say a character cannot see a particular location because he’s blindfolded. He leaves that location, but uses radial navigation to get a fix on it. That means he can still teleport back there. Furthermore, if the character has a fix on a place, he can reach it through the astral plane in just seven hours, the minimum possible (assuming of course that he can travel through the astral plane). And he can reach the same location by dimension walking (see the psychoportation discipline) with no chance of getting lost. Radial navigation can aid in telepathy, too.

It is best suited to converting one sort of element into another, but it can also be used for more complex operations—neutralizing a poison, for example.\n&emsp;Converting one element to another is usually a simple operation, in which one ounce of material can be changed each hour. Typical conversions of this type include steel to lead, or any metal to gold. More complex rearrangement, like changing a metal to glass or changing a wooden goblet to a ruby goblet, takes four times longer.\n&emsp;The creation of gold coins from other metals is possible, but it’s no way to get rich quick. At the rate of one ounce per hour, it would take 16 hours—about two work days—to change 10 copper pieces into 10 gold pieces, for a net profit of 9 gold pieces.\n&emsp;Molecular rearrangement is often used to create superior weapons. A psionically tempered weapon may receive a +1 on damage rolls (see “Weapon Quality” in Chapter 6 of the *DMG*). The process is time-consuming, however. For example, a typical short sword takes at least 40 hours to temper psionically. (The average short sword weighs 3 pounds, or 48 ounces, most of which is the blade.) A psionically tempered weapon does *not* automatically offer a +1 attack-roll bonus. In order to receive that bonus, the psionicist must 1) have the weaponsmithing proficiency and 2) make a successful proficiency check when he fashions the weapon.\n&emsp;The psionicist makes his power check when the process is complete.

The victim can’t do anything else during this contest; all his effort is focused on retaining control of his own body.\n&emsp;If the power works, the psionicist has rudimentary control over the victim’s limbs. He can make the victim stand up, sit down, walk, turn around, etc. The body can be forced to attack physically, but with a -6 penalty on attack rolls (using the victim’s own TAHC0). The victim can’t be forced to speak. In fact, he keeps control over his own voice and can say whatever he likes.\n&emsp;The victim must stay within the 80-yard range or the psionicist’s control is broken automatically. If the body is forced to do something obviously suicidal, like walking off a cliff or poking at a red dragon, the victim can fight another contest with the psionicist to regain control (the adrenaline rush of imminent danger gives him renewed strength).\n&emsp;*Power Score*—The psionicist automatically wins the initial psychic contest.\n&emsp;*20*—The psionicist suffers partial paralysis (an arm or leg) for 1d10 turns.'

    'effect': 'With probability travel, a psionicist can traverse the astral plane physically as if he’s in astral form. This power has a distinct advantage over magical astral travel. When a wizard uses the *astral spell*, he forms an astral body, which remains connected to his material body by a silvery cord. In contrast, a psionicist using probability travel never leaves his physical form; he brings it along. He has no cord, so, unlike the wizard, he can never die because his cord has been severed. (On the other hand, he can still be blown to bits.)\n&emsp;The astral plane boasts nothing that would attract tourists, but its two-dimensional color pools serve as highways to the outer planes. These pools, scattered randomly throughout the astral plane, provide connections to all surface layers of the outer planes.\n&emsp;Travel through the astral plane is speedy: 10 yards per minute per Intelligence point. However, distance on the astral plane does not equate to distance on other planes. After 1d6 + 6 hours of travel, the traveler reaches the color pool he sought. There is a flat 75% chance that this pool leads to the exact destination the character wants. Otherwise, it is at least 10 miles off target—maybe more.\n&emsp;The psionicist can take other persons (as defined by the *charm person* spell) along on his probability trip. Each passenger costs 12 extra PSPs initially, plus 4 extra PSPs per hour, and adds one-half hour to the time needed to find the correct color pool. Passengers must travel voluntarily; this power cannot drag a character into the astral plane against his will.\n&emsp;Combat on the astral plane is unusual. The traveler’s physical body cannot affect astral bodies in any way. However, psionic powers do work against the minds of astral travelers. Most magical items do not work in the astral plane. Magical items which are keyed to a particular plane do function there, often with enhanced effect.\n&emsp;If the psionicist simply turns off this power while in the astral plane, he doesn’t leave. Instead, he’s stranded, unable to move except by physically pushing off of solid objects (which are extremely rare in the astral plane). He’s also stranded if he runs out of PSPs or is knocked unconscious on the astral plane. The only exit from this plane is a color pool.\n&emsp;If you’d like to learn more about traveling on the astral plane, see the new *PLANESCAPE* accessory.\n&emsp;*Power Score*—The color pool is right where the character wants it to be.\n&emsp;*20*—The character attracts the attention of an astral creature, which may or may not be hostile, at the DM’s discretion.'

This psionic power does neither; it merely teleports something. To be rid of the creature, the psionicist must banish it, teleport it again, kill it, or control it somehow. If the creature is intelligent, the psionicist might reason with it. However, the creature is almost certain to fly into a murderous rage when it discovers its plight.\n&emsp;The psionicist can make the summoned creature materialize anywhere within 200 yards of his present position. This is a tremendous advantage, since the creature, at least initially, has no idea who summoned it. Its anger is likely to be vented against the first target it finds. However, if the psionicist’s power check result was a 2, this range is reduced to 50 yards. If the result was a 1, the creature pops in within 10 yards. Obviously, some risk is involved.\n&emsp;The psionicist chooses the plane from which the creature will come. He does not choose the creature, however; that’s determined at random. A creature from one of the elemental planes usually will be an elemental of the appropriate type. A creature from an outer plane probably will be a native of that particular plane, but it could also be a visitor, or even an adventurer who happened to be in the wrong place at the right time. In contrast, the astral or ethereal planes are a cornucopia of creatures, frequented by beings of every imaginable description.

    'effect': 'Teleport is the essential power within this discipline. It allows the psionicist to teleport to a familiar spot. The destination must be a place that the character knows and can picture mentally—even if he’s never actually been there. For example, a psionicist may still know a location that he has seen through a crystal ball, via a sight link, or even by scanning someone else’s mind for the information.\n&emsp;The psionicist can still teleport to a place even if it has somehow changed from the way he pictures it. For example, if a room has been rearranged, or is currently on fire, such changes won’t affect the teleport.\n&emsp;Teleports always take characters to a fixed location. For example, if a character tries to teleport into a gypsy wagon which is on the move, he’ll arrive at the wagon’s location when he last knew it. The wagon itself may be miles away by then. Also, if the character was picturing the wagon’s interior, he will teleport to the space corresponding to the wagon’s interior—which is several feet off the ground! Because the wagon itself has moved, the teleporter will fall when he arrives. (Imagine teleporting to a room on the fifth floor of a tower, only to discover the tower has been razed by marauders since your last visit.)\n&emsp;Teleportation is instantaneous. The teleporting character simply ceases to exist in his previous location and springs into being at the destination. There is a slight, audible “pop” at both ends, as air rushes into the sudden vacuum or is instantly displaced.\n&emsp;Restraints do not affect teleportation. A character who is tied up, shackled to a wall, or buried up to his neck can still teleport. The restraints remain behind.\n&emsp;Clothing, on the other hand, does accompany a character who teleports. He may also carry small items in his grasp or wear equipment (e.g., armor) on his person, not exceeding one-fifth of his own body mass. If he doubles the amount of PSPs expended, he can carry up to three times his body mass, or take along one or two other characters on whom he has a firm grasp.\n&emsp;A character can teleport any distance, but as the distance increases, so does the chance of failure and the cost in PSPs.

    'effect': 'Like teleportation, a dimensional door takes a character from one location to another. The similarity stops there, however. With dimensional door, the psionicist opens a man-sized portal which leads to the edge of another dimension. The edge acts as a lightning-quick transit system, carrying travelers to a destination chosen by the psionicist who uses this power.\n&emsp;When the psionicist uses this devotion, he creates a door leading into the alternate dimension. The door is a vaguely outlined portal, which appears in front of the psionicist. At the same time, an identical portal appears wherever he wants it, within range (see below). The door can have whatever orientation the psionicist chooses. If someone (including the psionicist) steps into either portal, he immediately steps out of the other. Both doors remain in place for as long as the psionicist maintains the power.\n&emsp;The dimension accessed by this power is not fully understood. Clearly, it has very different qualities of time and space, such that motion is greatly accelerated. For many years this transit was thought to be instantaneous, but arduous experiments by Larue d’jar Azif of Dhaztanar have proved that a very tiny bit of time does elapse. What this means is still unknown.\n&emsp;Travel via this power is disorienting. Presumably, exposure to the alternate dimension traumatizes the body in some way. As a result, a traveler is dazed and cannot attack or move for one round after stepping through a dimensional skip portal. Quick transit is advisable. People who shove only an arm through a portal suffer intense pain. Fools who poke their head through a portal must make a system shock roll; failure means they lose 50% of their current hit points and pass out.\n&emsp;Inanimate objects are not affected by exposure to the dimension’s edge. In fact, a character can throw or fire objects through a portal, and they’ll come out on the other side. Attackers suffer a -4 penalty on their to-hit rolls against targets on the other side of the dimension’s edge.\n&emsp;**Range:** The normal range of this power—i.e., the maximum distance between the two portals—is 50 yards.

This has two advantages over a dimensional door: 1) a dimension walk is not physically traumatizing and 2) the range of travel is greater. On the other hand, dimension walk only allows the psionicist himself to travel, and he can easily get lost.\n&emsp;The dimension walker opens up a vaguely shimmering portal. Only the psionicist who opened the portal can enter it. As soon as he does, the portal closes behind him. He finds himself engulfed by an inky grayness that is virtually without features. The effect is one of extreme sensory deprivation.\n&emsp;The psionicist can travel through this gray realm at a speed of 7 leagues (21 miles) per turn. He cannot see where he is or where he’s going while in the realm. He has only his instinct to guide him, and must make a Wisdom check every turn. If these checks succeed, he’ll find himself at his chosen destination when he steps out of the realm. If any single Wisdom check fails, however, the character will stray off course by several miles. When the walker steps out of the gray realm, the DM can place him in any location, within the maximum distance from his starting point (e.g., if the psionicist walked for 10 rounds, he must be within 21 miles of his origin). It’s up to the psionicist to figure out his location; this power doesn’t help him gain his bearings.\n&emsp;Aside from getting lost, dimension walking is completely safe. Apparently anything that lives in the other dimensions crossed cannot interact with dimensional travelers (Larue d’jar Azif of Dhaztanar postulated that these other dimensions teem with life just as much as our own, but because the traveler is crossing them “against the grain”, as it were, they do not register on his senses.)

Once asleep, he begins fashioning a dream that involves traveling from his present location to his intended destination. At the beginning of the journey, the DM secretly makes a power check for the character. If the check succeeds, the psionicist will reach his destination. If the check fails, the character will fall short 10% for each point that the die roll exceeded the power score.\n&emsp;If the DM wants, this power check is all that’s required to handle dream travel during a game. However, it’s far more satisfying to actually role-play the dream. The player creates the setting and describes his intentions, with the DM interrupting to change things arbitrarily and throw obstacles in the character’s path. If the player overcomes the obstacles and solves problems inventively, the DM is justified in giving a bonus to the character’s power check. If the dream is dull and lifeless, the DM can also penalize the power check.\n&emsp;The DM should remember that this is a dream; terrain on the journey may not resemble actual terrain, the character may be completely different, and the world may be completely strange. The length of the dream journey should be approximately the same as the real distance, however, and the final destination should be at least similar to the real destination. Such dream adventures should minimize combat and maximize problems, puzzles, and surreal atmosphere.

If, for example, a *fireball* spell detonates in the room while the character is time shifted, the character is completely protected against its effects. In fact, unless the blast leaves visible effects (charred walls or corpses or sulfurous fumes), the character won’t even know it happened. He sees none of the intervening events.\n&emsp;This power cannot help a character escape contact, however. If someone has established contact or tangents (see Chapter 2) with the time shifter—and continues paying their maintenance cost—then the tangents or contact will still be in effect when the character returns to normal time.\n&emsp;Time shifting offers an obvious advantage in combat. A psionicist can leap one round into the future and maneuver into position for an attack. In that case, the shifter receives a +4 bonus to his attack roll. With enough time, he could even escape.\n&emsp;How long does a time shift last? If the psionicist travels one round forward, then he has one round in which to maneuver. If he travels two rounds forward, then it takes two rounds for reality to catch up. Three rounds is the limit.

    'effect': 'Contact must be established before virtually any telepathic power can be used on another character or creature. It is just what its name implies—contact between the minds of the telepath and another character or creature. Contact does not allow communication by itself; it is merely the conduit for other telepathic exchanges.\n&emsp;Many telepathic powers list “contact” as their initial cost. That means contact must be established in a previous round before those powers can be used. As long as contact is maintained, the psionicist can use other powers which require it, and can even switch (using attraction and then mindlink on the same subject after contact was established, for example).\n&emsp;A psionicist can maintain contact with more than one subject at a time, but he must contact each one individually, and pay a maintenance cost for each use of the power. For example, if a psionicist wishes to inspire awe in two subjects, he must establish and maintain contact with each one separately.\n&emsp;Once contact is established, it costs 1 PSP per round to maintain. The psionicist can perform any other action while maintaining contact. *If he uses another telepathic power on the same subject while maintaining contact, the contact power is “free.”* (The cost of maintaining contact is covered by the other power’s cost).\n&emsp;**Establishing Contact:** The initial cost of contact is based on the target’s level or hit dice, as shown below.}}{{style=bottom2}}{{cs1-1=2}}{{cs2-1=2}}{{cs3-1=2}}{{cs4-1=2}}{{c1-1=1-5 levels or hit dice}}{{c2-1=6-10 levels or hit dice}}{{c3-1=11-15 levels or hit dice}}{{c4-1=16-20 levels or hit dice}}{{c1-2=3 PSPs/round}}{{c2-2=8 PSPs/round}}{{cc3-2=min sheet-spell-fixed}}{{c3-2=13 PSPs/round}}{{c4-2=18 PSPs/round}}{{cc5-1=justify}}{{cs5-1=3}}{{c5-1=\n&emsp;A psionicist cannot contact a subject that he knows nothing about. In other words, he can’t use this power to scan around and “see what’s out there.” He must either have his subject in sight or know specifically who or what he is looking for. He cannot, for example, try to contact any random orc which may or may not be standing behind a closed door. However, he can try to contact a *particular* orc which he has seen before.\n&emsp;If a psionicist fails to establish contact, he can try again the next round. Failure doesn’t necessarily mean the target’s mind cannot be contacted. Rather, it means the target has not been found yet. The psionicist can continue searching.\n&emsp;Several factors can make telepathic contact difficult to establish:\n\n}}{{cc6-1=min}}{{c6-1=•}}{{cc7-1=min}}{{c7-1=•}}{{cc8-1=min}}{{c8-1=•}}{{cs6-2=2}}{{c6-2=how far the target is (distance)}}{{cs7-2=2}}{{c7-2=resistance by the target—especially if the target is a psionicist}}{{cs8-2=2}}{{c8-2=whether or not the target is an intelligent mammal}} {{cc9-1=justify}}{{cs9-1=3}}{{c9-1=&emsp;Each factor is described below.\n\n&emsp;**Distance:** The greater the distance between the two minds, the more difficult it usually becomes to make contact. If the psionicist can see the target—either with normal vision or by using psionic powers—distance is not a factor. If the psionicist cannot see his target, normal range modifiers apply. Simply knowing where to look does not constitute “seeing the target.”\n\n}}{{cs10-1=2}}{{cs11-1=2}}{{cs12-1=2}}{{cs13-1=2}}{{cs14-1=2}}{{cs15-1=2}}{{cs16-1=2}}{{cc10-1=bottom}}{{c10-1=**Separation**\n**Distance**}}{{c11-1=Line-of-sight}}{{c12-1=1 mile}}{{c13-1=10 miles}}{{c14-1=100 miles}}{{c15-1=1,000 miles}}{{c16-1=10,000 miles}}{{cc10-2=center}}{{cc11-2=center}}{{cc12-2=center}}{{cc13-2=center}}{{cc14-2=center}}{{cc15-2=center}}{{cc16-2=center}}{{c10-2=**Power Score**\n**Modifier**}}{{c11-2=0}}{{c12-2=-1}}{{c13-2=-3}}{{c14-2=-5}}{{c15-2=-7}}{{c16-2=-9}}{{cc17-1=justify}}{{cs17-1=4}}{{c17-1=\n&emsp;The maximum range for establishing contact is 10,000 miles when a psionicist cannot view his subject. Contact can be maintained across any distance, however; it is not broken if a contacted subject moves out of range. There is one exception: contact *cannot* be extended beyond a crystal sphere.\n&emsp;**Resistance:** An untrained character—i.e., a nonpsionicist—can actively resist intrusion, resulting in a -2 modifier to the psionicist’s power score. To resist, the character fills his mind with a barrage of thoughts and emotions—much as a child avoids a lecture by plugging his ears and yelling. For example, a character might repeat a poem ad nauseam, or scream battle cries. However, even these efforts won’t work unless 1) the character is specifically resisting psychic intrusion, and 2) resisting intrusion is his sole activity. If the character tries to fight or cast a spell, for example, his psychic defense has too many “holes” to be useful. Unless a wild talent knows a telepathic defense mode, he is as vulnerable to contact as any nonpsionicist.\n&emsp;Psionicists (and psionic creatures) are much better at resisting contact. In fact, this power won’t work against them unless they intentionally drop their natural defenses. They must *allow* another psionicist to use contact on them, and can exclude some contacts while remaining open to others. If a psionicist resists, contact can only be established through mental attacks: psychic crush, ego whip, id insinuation, mind thrust, or psionic blast. See Chapter 2, “Psionic Combat,” for more information.\n&emsp;**Unusual Subjects:** Contact can also be established with nonhuman minds, even plants. The further the subject is removed from mammals, the more difficult it becomes to establish contact. Modifiers that affect power scores are listed below.\n\n}}{{cs18-1=2}}{{cs19-1=2}}{{cs20-1=2}}{{cs21-1=2}}{{cs22-1=2}}{{cs23-1=2}}{{cs24-1=2}}{{cs25-1=2}}{{cs26-1=2}}{{cc18-1=bottom}}{{c18-1=**Life Order**}}{{c19-1=Mammal (except marsupial)}}{{c20-1=Marsupial}}{{c21-1=Bird}}{{c22-1=Reptile, amphibian}}{{c23-1=Fish}}{{c24-1=Arachnid, insect}}{{c25-1=Monster}}{{c26-1=Plant}}{{cc18-2=center}}{{cc19-2=center}}{{cc20-2=center}}{{cc21-2=center}}{{cc22-2=center}}{{cc23-2=center}}{{cc24-2=center}}{{cc25-2=center}}{{cc26-2=center}}{{c18-2=**Contact**\n**Score**\n**Modifier**}}{{c19-2=-1}}{{c20-2=-2}}{{c21-2=-3}}{{c22-2=-4}}{{c23-2=-5}}{{c24-2=-6}}{{c25-2=-7}}{{c26-2=-8}}{{effects2=These modifiers are in addition to any distance modifiers that may apply. That means contacting a distant plant or monster is an uncertain proposition at best.\n&emsp;**Breaking Contact:** Contact is not severed until the psionicist breaks it off (fails to maintain it). If the person contacted is a psionicist, he may also do something to sever it. A psionicist often can eject an unwanted intruder (see “ejection”).\n&emsp;**Optional Rule:** The minds of very intelligent beings are more difficult to latch onto. Increase the cost of contact by adding the creature’s “# of Languages,” minus two, as shown on Table 4 in Chapter 1 of the *Player’s Handbook*. For example, a creature with Intelligence 17 knows six languages. The cost of contacting this creature’s mind is increased by four.\n&emsp;*Power Score*—The contact is maintained for four rounds for free.\n&emsp;*20*—Further contact with this mind is impossible at this experience level.'

The process, which requires extraordinary time and effort, is described below.\n&emsp;**Item Requirements.** An item must meet two requirements before it can be empowered. First, it must be of exceptional quality—worth 250% to 500% of the normal cost for an item of its type. Second, it must be new. The process of empowering must begin within 48 hours after the item is manufactured. If it is delayed longer, the item cannot be empowered. (If the psionicist still tries, he automatically fails Step One below, expending 50 PSPs.) If the item meets these two requirements, the psionicist can begin the empowerment.\n&emsp;**Step One.** At the start of each day, the psionicist must first prepare the item to receive psionic power. This costs 50 PSPs and requires a power check. If this check fails, the day is wasted; no further progress can be made until the next day.\n&emsp;**Step Two.** If the item has been prepared, the psionicist can give it access to a discipline. It can have access to only one discipline, never more, and the psionicist himself must have access to it. This step costs 100 PSPs and requires a power check.\n&emsp;**Step Three.** The psionicist can attempt to empower the item with any single power he knows within the chosen discipline. (The item must have been properly prepared on the same day.) The psionicist must make two successful power checks: first, a check for the chosen power (using the appropriate power score), and second, another empower check. If both checks succeed, the item has that psionic power, with a score two points below the psionicist’s. If Step Three is successful, the psionicist expends another 100 PSPs. (Failure means he expends half that amount, as usual.)\n&emsp;**Step Four.** The psionicist can imbue the item with other powers by repeating Step Three. The item can acquire *one* power per day, provided it has been properly prepared (see Step One).\n&emsp;**Step Five.** When the item has acquired all the powers which the psionicist intends to give it, the psionicist can seal those powers within the item. To do this, he must prepare the item one more time (expending 50 PSPs), and make an endowment power check one last time. If the item is sealed successfully, it can never gain any additional powers—but it can’t lose them, either. An item that has not been sealed will lose one power per month until it is just a normal object again.\n&emsp;An empowered object has 8 PSPs per devotion and 12 per science. It has Intelligence equal to its maker’s intelligence minus 1d6 points, with a minimum of 12. Its ego is 2 points per devotion and 3 points per science. Unless it was empowered with another telepathic power, it communicates as indicated on Table 113, “Weapon Intelligence and Capabilities” in the AD&D 2nd Edition *DMG* (p. 246). Its alignment matches its creator’s. The weapon has its own personality, however, and like all intelligent weapons, it will try to assert its independence at every opportunity.\n&emsp;The empowering process must be unbroken. *If a day passes in which the psionicist does not at least try to prepare the object, it is finished as is.* He cannot even try to seal the powers; they will wear off over the course of time.\n&emsp;*Power Score*—No other effect.\n&emsp;*20*—If three 20’s are rolled during the empowering process, the item is a complete and utter failure.'

He cannot use these points when his total pool of psionic strength is at its maximum. However, he can keep the stored PSPs on hand until he’s running low on psionic energy, and then use them immediately. (It’s like storing a pint of your own blood at a hospital. With a little time, your body replaces the pint. Later, if you should lose blood in an accident or operation, you can use the stored blood to recover the loss quickly.)\n&emsp;Before powers can be stored, a receptacle must be prepared. Two types of containers are appropriate: a vessel prepared with empower (a metapsionic science), or a valuable gem that has been specially prepared using the receptacle power.\n&emsp;**Empowered Vessel.** Any vessel can serve as a receptacle for psionic energy if it is empowered first. The psionicist must perform the initial preparation and final sealing described earlier under “empower.” He does not do anything further; the vessel needs no additional powers. It can hold PSPs equal to his psionic potential, multiplied by his experience level.\n&emsp;**Valuable Gem.** A gem can hold 1 PSP for every 100 gold pieces of its worth, rounded down. For example, a gem worth 650 gold pieces can hold 6 PSPs, and a gem worth 1,000 gold pieces can hold 10 PSPs. The gem still requires preparation, however. To do this, the psionicist must slowly fill the gem with PSPs—1 per turn—until the gem reaches maximum capacity (1/100 of its value). The psionicist can do nothing else while filling the gem. When the task is complete, the psionicist must make a power check. If he fails, only one-half of the gem’s capacity is useable.\n&emsp;**Storing Points.** Using his receptacle power, he can automatically place 1 PSP into a properly prepared container per round. When he is finished, the psionicist must make a receptacle power check. If it succeeds, all is well; if it fails, only half the points he expended are stored in the receptacle, while the rest are merely spent.\n&emsp;**Using Stored Points.** The psionicist can retrieve stored points automatically. The receptacle must be in contact with his flesh. He can never retrieve more points than the receptacle currently holds, *nor can he retrieve so many that it raises his current psionic point total above his maximum*. No matter how many receptacles he has, a psionicist can never store more PSPs than his maximum total. (For example, if his usual maximum is 100 PSPs, he can store no more than 100.) Only the psionicist who placed the points in the item can use them.\n&emsp;The danger of this power is receptacle loss. If the receptacle is damaged or destroyed, its contents (PSPs) are instantly subtracted from the psionicist’s total possible points. This loss is temporary, but until the psionicist is once again back up to his full PSP score he recovers PSPs only half as fast as normal.\n&emsp;*Power Score*—No other effect.\n&emsp;*20*—No other effect.'

This is very difficult, however, and it requires great precision. The more powers the psionicist attempts to splice, the more likely he is to fail.\n&emsp;First, the character must make a successful splice check. His power score is decreased 2 points for each power being spliced. For example, if he is splicing two powers, his score equals Intelligence -4. The initial cost of this endeavor is 5 PSPs for every power being spliced.\n&emsp;If the character passes this first power check, he must then initiate each spliced power in succession—without interruption. He does not have to make a separate splicing check for each of these powers, but he still pays their initial costs. Furthermore, each spliced power has absolutely no effect at this time.\n&emsp;Once all the powers have been initiated, the psionicist must make a second splice check. (His power score is still reduced two points for each power being spliced.) If he fails this check, all his efforts are lost; the PSPs he spent are gone, and none of the powers works. If the power check succeeds, the psionicist can maintain the splice by expending 1 PSP per spliced power per round.\n&emsp;At any later time (during which the splice has been maintained), the psionicist can unleash the spliced series of powers. In effect, he performs all of the spliced powers simultaneously—or with split second separations if desired. Success is not automatic. The psionicist must perform the individual power checks for these spliced powers when he releases them. He does not have to pay their initial costs again, however.\n&emsp;The maximum number of powers that a psionicist can splice equals his experience level. For example, a 2nd level psionicist can splice up to two powers, and a 3rd level psionicist can splice up to three. A complex splice is a long shot at best, however. As noted above, a psionicist’s power score decreases two points for every power he attempts to splice.

For example, a 10th level psionicist can create a field with up to a 10-yard radius.\n&emsp;From the outside, the stasis field looks like a slightly shimmering, completely smooth silver globe.

Movement is slowed down visibly, and swift objects are affected more than slow objects. Character and creature movement rates are halved. A dagger can easily be pushed through someone, but a lightninglike slash with a sword is slowed to a graceful arc, almost like slow motion.
