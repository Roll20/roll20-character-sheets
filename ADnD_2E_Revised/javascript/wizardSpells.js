Note that this does not affect either fuel consumption or damage caused by the fire. The caster can affect any or all fires in the spell’s area. He can alter their intensities with a single gesture as long as the spell is in effect. The spell lasts until the caster cancels it, all fuel is burned, or the duration expires. The caster can also extinguish all flames in the area, which expends the spell immediately. The spell does not affect fire elementals or similar creatures.'

The area of effect can be a portal, a section of floor, stairs, etc. As soon as any creature enters the warded area, touches it, or otherwise contacts it without speaking a password established by the caster, the *alarm* spell lets out a loud ringing that can be heard clearly within a 60-foot radius. (Reduce the radius by 10 feet for each interposing door and by 20 feet for each substantial interposing wall.) The sound lasts for one round and then ceases. Ethereal or astrally projected creatures do not trigger an alarm, but flying or levitating creatures, invisible creatures, or incorporeal or gaseous creatures do. The caster can dismiss the alarm with a single word.'

The spell has no effect on a person already armored or a creature with Armor Class 6 or better. It is not cumulative with the *shield* spell, but it is cumulative with Dexterity and, in case of fighter/mages, with the shield bonus. The *armor* spell does not hinder movement or prevent spellcasting, and adds no weight or encumbrance. It lasts until successfully dispelled or until the wearer sustains cumulative damage totaling greater than 8 points + 1 per level of the caster ([[8+[[@{level-wizard}]] ]] points). (It is important to note that the armor does *not* absorb this damage. The armor merely grants an AC of 6; the wearer still suffers full damage from any successful attacks.) Thus, the wearer might suffer 8 points from an attack, then several minutes later sustain an additional 1 point of damage. Unless the spell were cast by a wizard of 2nd level or higher, it would be dispelled at this time. Until it is dispelled, the *armor* spell grants the wearer full benefits of the Armor Class gained.'

    'effect': 'When the *audible glamer* spell is cast, the wizard causes a volume of sound to arise, at whatever distance he desires (within range), and seem to recede, approach, or remain at a fixed place as desired. The volume of sound created, however, is directly related to the level of the spellcaster. The noise of the *audible glamer* is that of 4 men per level of the caster. Current noise is [[4*[[@{level-wizard}]] ]] men. Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created. The auditory illusion created by an *audible glamer* spell can be virtually any type of sound, but the relative volume must be commensurate with the level of the wizard casting the spell. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight men running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise volume of 16 men, while a roaring dragon is equal to the noise volume of no fewer than 24 men.\n&emsp;A character stating that he does not believe the sound receives a saving throw, and if it succeeds, the character then hears a faint and obviously false sound, emanating from the caster’s direction.

    'effect': 'Cantrips are minor spells studied by wizards during their apprenticeship, regardless of school. The *cantrip* spell is a practice method for the apprentice, teaching him how to tap minute amounts of magical energy. Once cast, the *cantrip* spell enables the caster to create minor magical effects for the duration of the spell. However, these effects are so minor that they have severe limitations. They are completely unable to cause a loss of hit points, cannot affect the concentration of spellcasters, and can only create small, obviously magical materials. Furthermore, materials created by a cantrip are extremely fragile and cannot be used as tools of any sort. Lastly, a cantrip lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects.\n&emsp;Whatever manifestation the cantrip takes, it remains in effect only as long as the wizard concentrates. Wizards typically use cantrips to impress common folk, amuse children, and brighten dreary lives. Common tricks with cantrips include tinklings of ethereal music, brightening faded flowers, glowing balls that float over the caster’s hand, puffs of wind to flicker candles, spicing up aromas and flavors of bland food, and little whirlwinds to sweep dust under rugs. Combined with the *unseen servant* spell, it’s a tool to make housekeeping and entertaining simpler for the wizard.'

The duration of the spell is 2d6 rounds plus two additional rounds per level of experience of the spellcaster. The DM may allow a saving throw for disbelief under certain circumstances: for example, if the caster acts in a manner obviously inconsistent with his chosen role. The spell does not alter the perceived tactile (i.e., touch) properties of the caster or his equipment, and the ruse can be discovered in this way.'

Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not.\n&emsp;The person receives a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect, with any adjustment due to Wisdom (see Table 5). If the person receives damage from the caster’s group in the same round the *charm* is cast, an additional bonus of +1 per hit point of damage received is added to the victim’s saving throw.\n&emsp;If the spell recipient fails his saving throw, he regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The spell does not enable the caster to control the charmed creature as if it were an automaton, but any word or action of the caster is viewed in the most favorable way. Thus, a charmed person would not obey a suicide command, but he might believe the caster if assured that the only chance to save the caster’s life is for the person to hold back an onrushing red dragon for “just a minute or two.” Note also that the spell does not endow the caster with linguistic capabilities beyond those he normally possesses (i.e., he must speak the victim’s language to communicate his commands).\n&emsp;The duration of the spell is a function of the charmed person’s Intelligence and is tied to the saving throw. The spell may be broken if a successful saving throw is rolled, and this saving throw is checked on a periodic basis, according to the creature’s Intelligence (see the following table). If the caster harms, or attempts to harm, the charmed person by some overt action, or if a *dispel magic* spell is successfully cast upon the charmed person, the *charm* spell is broken.\n&emsp;If two or more *charm* effects simultaneously affect a creature, the result is decided by the DM. This could range from one effect being clearly dominant, to the subject being torn by conflicting desires, to new saving throws that could negate both spells.\n&emsp;Note that the subject has full memory of the events that took place while he was charmed.}}{{style=center1 sheet-spell-center2}}{{c1-1=**Intelligence Score**}}{{c2-1=3 or less}}{{c3-1=4–6}}{{c4-1=7–9}}{{c5-1=10–12}}{{c6-1=13–14}}{{c7-1=15–16}}{{c8-1=17}}{{c9-1=18}}{{c10-1=19 or more}}{{c1-2=**Time Between Checks**}}{{c2-2=3 months}}{{c3-2=2 months}}{{c4-2=1 month}}{{c5-2=3 weeks}}{{c6-2=2 weeks}}{{c7-2=1 week}}{{c8-2=3 days}}{{c9-2=2 days}}{{c10-2=1 day}}{{effects2=&emsp;**Note:** The period between checks is the time period during which the check occurs.

It grows by up to 10% per level of experience of the wizard ([[10*[[@{level-wizard}]] ]]%), increasing this amount in height, width, and weight.\n&emsp;All equipment worn or carried by a creature is enlarged by the spell. Unwilling victims are entitled to a saving throw vs. spell. A successful saving throw means the spell fails. If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size, bursting weak enclosures in the process, but it is constrained without harm by stronger materials—the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by growth.\n&emsp;Magical properties are not increased by this spell—a huge *sword +1* is still only +1, a staff-sized wand is still only capable of its normal functions, a giant-sized potion merely requires a greater fluid intake to make its magical effects operate, etc. Weight, mass, and strength are affected, though. Thus, a table blocking a door would be heavier and more effective, a hurled stone would have more mass (and cause more damage), chains would be more massive, doors thicker, a thin line turned to a sizeable, longer rope, and so on. A creature’s hit points, Armor Class, and attack rolls do not change, but damage rolls increase proportionately with size.For example, a fighter at 160% normal size hits with his long sword and rolls a 6 for damage. The adjusted damage roll is 10 (that is, 6 × 1.6 = 9.6, rounded up). Bonuses due to Strength, class, and magic are not altered.\n&emsp;The reverse spell, *reduce*, negates the *enlarge* spell or makes creatures or objects smaller. The creature or object loses 10% of its original size for every level of the caster, to a minimum of 10% of the original size. Thereafter, the size shrinks by 1-foot increments to less than 1 foot, by 1-inch increments to 1 inch, and by 1⁄10-inch increments to a minimum of 1⁄10 of an inch—the recipient cannot dwindle away to nothingness.\n&emsp;For example, a 16-foot-tall giant reduced by a 15th-level wizard (15 steps) would be reduced to 1.6 feet (in nine steps), then to 6⁄10 of a foot or 7.2 inches (in one step), and finally to 2.2 inches (in the last five steps). A shrinking object may damage weaker materials affixed to it, but an object will shrink only as long as the object itself is not damaged. Unwilling creatures are allowed a saving throw vs. spell.'

However, when the spell duration ceases, a normal rate of fall occurs. The spell can be cast upon the wizard or some other creature or object up to the maximum range and lasts for one round for each level of the wizard. The *feather fall* affects one or more objects or creatures in a 10-foot cube, as long as the maximum weight of the creatures or objects does not exceed a combined total of 200 pounds plus 200 pounds per level of the spellcaster. Current weight limit: [[200+(200*[[@{level-wizard}]])]] pounds.\n&emsp;For example, a 2nd-level wizard has a range of 20 yards, a duration of two rounds, and a weight limit of 600 pounds when casting this spell.

    'effect': 'This spell enables the caster to attempt to summon a familiar to act as his aide and companion. Familiars are typically small creatures, such as cats, frogs, ferrets, crows, hawks, snakes, owls, ravens, toads, weasels, or even mice. A creature acting as a familiar can benefit a wizard, conveying its sensory powers to its master, conversing with him, and serving as a guard/scout/spy as well. A wizard can have only one familiar at a time, however, and he has no control over what sort of creature answers the summoning, if any at all come.\n&emsp;The creature is always more intelligent than others of its type (typically by 2 or 3 Intelligence points), and its bond with the wizard confers upon it an exceptionally long life. The wizard receives the heightened senses of his familiar, which grants the wizard a +1 bonus to all surprise die rolls. Normal familiars have 2–4 hit points plus 1 hit point per caster level, and an Armor Class of 7 (due to size, speed, etc.).\n&emsp;The wizard has an empathic link with the familiar and can issue it mental commands at a distance of up to 1 mile. Note that empathic responses from the familiar are generally fairly basic—while able to communicate simple thoughts, these are often overwhelmed by instinctual responses. Thus, a ferret familiar spying on a band of orcs in the woods might lose its train of thought upon sighting a mouse. Certainly its communications to its master would be tinged with fear of the “big ones” it was spying on! The caster cannot see through the familiar’s eyes.\n&emsp;If separated from the caster, the familiar loses 1 hit point each day, and dies if reduced to 0 hit points. When the familiar is in physical contact with its wizard, it gains the wizard’s saving throws against special attacks. If a special attack would normally cause damage, the familiar suffers no damage if the saving throw is successful and half damage if the saving throw is failed. If the familiar dies, the wizard must successfully roll an immediate system shock check or die. Even if he survives this check, the wizard loses 1 point from his Constitution when the familiar dies.\n&emsp;The power of the conjuration is such that it can be attempted but once per year. When the wizard decides to find a familiar, he must load a brass brazier with charcoal. When this is burning well, he adds 1,000 gp worth of incense and herbs. The spell incantation is then begun and must be continued until the familiar comes or the casting time is finished. The DM secretly determines all results. Note that most familiars are not inherently magical, nor does a *dispel magic* spell send them away.\n&emsp;Deliberate mistreatment, failure to feed and care for the familiar, or continuous unreasonable demands have adverse effects on the familiar’s relationship with its master. Purposely arranging the death of one’s own familiar incurs great disfavor from certain powerful entities, with dire results.}}{{style=center1 sheet-spell-fixed3 sheet-spell-min3}}{{cc1-1=bottom}}{{c1-1=**D20 Roll**}}{{c2-1=1–5}}{{c3-1=6–7}}{{c4-1=8–9}}{{c5-1=10–11}}{{c6-1=12–13}}{{c7-1=14–15}}{{c8-1=16–20}}{{cc1-2=bottom}}{{c1-2=**Familiar* **}}{{c2-2=Cat, black}}{{c3-2=Crow}}{{c4-2=Hawk}}{{c5-2=Owl}}{{c6-2=Toad}}{{c7-2=Weasel}}{{c8-2=No familiar available within spell range}}{{cs8-2=2}}{{cc1-3=bottom}}{{c1-3=**Sensory Powers**}}{{c2-3=Excellent night vision\n& superior hearing}}{{c3-3=Excellent vision}}{{c4-3=Very superior distance vision}}{{c5-3=Night vision equals human daylight\nvision, superior hearing}}{{c6-3=Wide-angle vision}}{{c7-3=Superior hearing & very\nsuperior olfactory power}}{{effects2=* The DM can substitute other small animals suitable to the area.'

Any consequences of this handling fall fully upon the wizard and may end the spell, although the wizard is allowed any applicable saving throw.\n&emsp;The chance of learning a piece of information about an item is equal to 10% per level of the caster, to a maximum of 90%, rolled by the DM. Current chance is [[{{(10*[[@{level-wizard}]]),90}kl1}]]%. Any roll of 96–00 indicates a false reading (91–95 reveals nothing). Only one function of a multifunction item is discovered per handling (i.e., a 5th-level wizard could attempt to determine the nature of five different items, five different functions of a single item, or any combination of the two). If any attempt at reading fails, the caster cannot learn any more about that item until he advances a level. Note that some items, such as special magical tomes, cannot be identified with this spell.\n&emsp;The item never reveals its exact attack or damage bonuses, although the fact that it has few or many bonuses can be determined. If it has charges, only a general indication of the number of charges remaining is learned: powerful (81% – 100% of the total possible charges), strong (61% – 80%), moderate (41% – 60%), weak (6% – 40%), or faint (five charges or less). The faint result takes precedence, so a fully charged *ring of three wishes* always appears to be only faintly charged.\n&emsp;After casting the spell and determining what can be learned from it, the wizard loses 8 points of Constitution. He must rest for one hour to recover each point of Constitution. If the 8-point loss drops the spellcaster below a Constitution of 1, he falls unconscious. Consciousness is not regained until full Constitution is restored, which takes 24 hours (one point per three hours for an unconscious character).\n&emsp;The material components infusion must be drunk prior to spellcasting. If a *luckstone* is powdered and added to the infusion, the divination becomes much more potent: Exact bonuses or charges can be determined, and the functions of a multifunctional item can be learned from a single reading.

Note that the protection does not prevent a vampire’s *charm* itself, but it does prevent the exercise of mental control through the barrier. Likewise, a possessing life force is merely kept out. It would not be expelled if in place before the protection is cast.\n&emsp;Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by creatures of an extraplanar or conjured nature (such as aerial servants, elementals, imps, invisible stalkers, salamanders, water weirds, xorn, and others). This causes the natural (body) weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil, if such attacks require touching the protected being. Animals or monsters summoned or conjured by spells or similar magic are likewise hedged from the character.\n&emsp;This protection ends if the protected character makes a melee attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature.\n&emsp;This spell can be reversed to become *protection from good*; the second and third benefits remain unchanged.

This spell does not empower horizontal movement, but the recipient could push along the face of a cliff, for example, to move laterally. The spellcaster can cancel the spell as desired. If the subject of the spell is unwilling, or the object is in the possession of a creature, a saving throw vs. spell is allowed to determine if the *levitate* spell affects it.\n&emsp;Once cast, the spell requires no concentration, except when changing height. A levitating creature attempting to use a missile weapon finds himself increasingly unstable; the first attack has an attack roll penalty of –1, the second –2, the third –3, etc., up to a maximum of –5. A full round spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at –1. Lack of leverage makes it impossible to cock a medium or heavy crossbow.'

Of course, the magic mouth can be placed upon a tree, rock, door, or any other object, excluding intelligent members of the animal or vegetable kingdoms.\n&emsp;The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled, according to the command of the spellcaster. Some examples are to speak “to the first creature that touches you,” or “to the first creature that passes within 30 feet.” Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used, such as the following: “Speak only when a venerable female human carrying a sack of groat clusters sits crosslegged within 1 foot.” Such visual triggers can react to a character using the *disguise* ability. Command range is 5 yards per level of the wizard ([[5*[[@{level-wizard}]] ]] yards), so a 6th-level wizard can command the magic mouth to speak at a maximum encounter range of 30 yards (“Speak when a winged creature comes within 30 yards.”).

If the saving throw is successful, two things may have occurred. If the creature has room to escape the area, then it is assumed to have jumped free. If there is no room to escape, then the webs are only half strength. Creatures with less than 13 Strength (7 if the webs are half strength) are stuck until freed by another or until the spell wears off. Missile fire is generally ineffective against creatures trapped in webs.\n&emsp;Creatures with Strengths between 13 and 17 can break through 1 foot of webs per round. Creatures with 18 or greater Strength can break through 2 feet of webs per round. If the webs are at half strength, these rates are doubled. (Great mass equates to great strength in this case, and creatures of large mass hardly notice webs.) Strong and huge creatures can break through 10 feet of webs per round.\n&emsp;Furthermore, the strands of a *web* spell are flammable. A magical *flaming sword* can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs. Any fire—torch, flaming oil, flaming sword, etc.—can set them alight and burn them away in a single round. All creatures within flaming webs suffer 2d4 points of damage from the flames, but those free of the strands are not harmed.'

The wizard disappears and instantaneously reappears 10 feet distant from his previous position. (Direction is determined by a roll of 1d8: 1 = right ahead, 2 = right, 3 = right behind, 4 = behind, 5 = left behind, 6 = left, 7 = left ahead, 8 = ahead.) The caster cannot blink into a solid object; if such is indicated, reroll the direction. Movable objects of size and mass comparable to the caster are shoved aside when the caster blinks in. If blinking is impossible except into a  fixed, solid object, the caster is then trapped on the Ethereal Plane.\n&emsp;During each round that he blinks, the spellcaster can be attacked only by opponents who win initiative or by those who are able to strike both locations at once (for example, with a breath weapon, fireball, or similar wide-area attack forms). Opponents with multiple attacks, or those operating under haste or similar effects, can often strike early enough to have at least one attack against the caster.\n&emsp;If the spellcaster holds off his attack (if any) until after the blink, the 2d8 delay until the blink is added to his normal 1d10 initiative roll (thus, he probably attacks last in the round). The spellcaster can also try  to get his attack in before he blinks (he must announce his intent before rolling the 2d8 for blink timing and the 1d10 for initiative). In this case, the caster compares the two dice rolls, hoping that his initiative roll is lower than his blink roll (the two rolls are *not* added if he is trying to attack before he blinks). If so, he attacks according to his initiative roll, then blinks according to the blink roll. If his blink roll is lower than his  initiative roll, however, he blinks first and then attacks in whatever direction he’s facing (he must go through with his attack, even if he is facing in the wrong direction to affect anyone).'

The base chance is 50% (11 or higher on 1d20 to dispel). If the caster is of higher level than the creator of the effect to be dispelled, the difference is subtracted from the number needed on 1d20 to dispel (making it more likely that the dispel succeeds); if the caster is of lower level, the difference is *added* to the number needed on 1d20 to dispel (making it *less* likely that the dispel succeeds).

A successful saving throw vs. spell reduces this damage to half (round fractions down). The bolt begins at a range and height decided by the caster and streaks outward in a direct line from the casting wizard (for example, if a 40-foot bolt was started at 180 feet from the wizard, the far end of the bolt would reach 220 feet (180 + 40). The lightning bolt may set fire to combustibles, sunder wooden doors, splinter up to a half-foot thickness of stone, and melt metals with a low melting point (lead, gold, copper, silver, bronze). Saving throws must be rolled for objects that withstand the full force of a stroke (see the *fireball* spell). If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it (i.e., the saving throw fails), the bolt continues. A bolt can breach 1 inch of wood or half an inch of stone per caster level, up to a maximum of 1 foot of wood or half a foot of stone.\n&emsp;The lightning bolt’s area of effect is chosen by the spellcaster: either a forked bolt 10 feet wide and 40 feet long or a single bolt 5 feet wide and 80 feet long. If a bolt cannot reach its full length, because of an unyielding barrier (such as a stone wall), the lightning bolt rebounds from the barrier toward its caster, ending only when it reaches its full length.\n&emsp;For example: An 80-foot-long stroke is begun at a range of 40 feet, but it hits a stone wall at 50 feet. The bolt travels 10 feet, hits the wall, and rebounds for 70 feet back toward its creator (who is only 50 feet from the wall, and so is caught in his own lightning bolt!).\n&emsp;The DM might allow reflecting bolts. When this type of lightning bolt strikes a solid surface, the bolt reflects from the surface at an angle equal to the angle of incidence (like light off a mirror). A creature crossed more than once by the bolt must roll a saving throw for every time it is crossed, but it still suffers either full damage (if one saving throw is missed) or half damage (if all saving throws are made).'

However, a suggestion that a pool of acid was actually pure water and that a quick dip would be refreshing is another matter.

    'effect': 'The *polymorph other* spell is a powerful magic that completely alters the form and ability, and possibly the personality and mentality, of the recipient. Of course, while a creature with a lower Intelligence can be polymorphed in form into something with a higher Intelligence, it will not gain that creature’s mental ability. The reverse—polymorphing a higher Intelligence creature into one of significantly lower Intelligence—results in a creature much more intelligent than appearances would lead one to believe. The polymorphed creature must succeed on a system shock (see Table 3) roll to see if it survives the change. After this, it must make a special Intelligence check to see if it retains its personality (see following).\n&emsp;The polymorphed creature acquires the form and physical abilities of the creature it has been polymorphed into, while retaining its own mind. Form includes natural Armor Class (that due to skin toughness, but not due to quickness, magical nature, etc.), physical movement abilities (walking, swimming, and flight with wings, but not plane shifting, blinking, teleporting, etc.), and attack routines (claw/claw/bite, swoop, rake, and constriction, but not petrification, breath weapons, energy drain, etc.). Hit points and saving throws do not change from the original form. Noncorporeal forms cannot be assumed. Natural shapeshifters (lycanthropes, dopplegangers, higher level druids, etc.) are affected for but one round, and can then resume their normal form.\n&emsp;If slain, the polymorphed creature reverts to its original form, though it remains dead. (Note that most creatures generally prefer their own form and will not willingly stand the risk of being subjected to this spell!) As class and level are not attributes of form, abilities derived from either cannot be gained by this spell, nor can exact ability scores be specified.\n&emsp;When the polymorph occurs, the creature’s equipment, if any, melds into the new form (in particularly challenging campaigns, the DM may allow protective devices, such as a *ring of protection,* to continue operating effectively). The creature retains its mental abilities, including spell use, assuming the new form allows completion of the proper verbal and somatic components and the material components are available. Creatures not used to a new form might be penalized at the DM’s option (for example, –2 to attack rolls) until they practice sufficiently to master it.\n&emsp;When the physical change occurs, there is a base 100% chance that the subject’s personality and mentality change into that of the new form (i.e., a roll of 20 or less on 1d20). For each 1 point of Intelligence of the subject, subtract 1 from the base chance on 1d20. Additionally, for every Hit Die of difference between the original form and the form it is assuming, add or subtract 1 (depending on whether the polymorphed form has more Hit Dice [or levels] or fewer Hit Dice [or levels] than original, respectively). The chance for assumption of the personality and mentality of the new form is checked daily until the change takes place.\n&emsp;A subject acquiring the mentality of the new form has effectively become the creature whose form was assumed and comes under the control of the DM until recovered by a *wish* spell or similar magic. Once this final change takes place, the creature acquires the new form’s full range of magical and special abilities.\n&emsp;For example: If a 1 Hit Die orc of 8 Intelligence is polymorphed into a white dragon with 6 Hit Dice, it is 85% (20 – 8 Intelligence + 5 level difference [6–1] = 17 out of 20 = 85%) likely to actually become one in all respects, but in any case it has the dragon’s physical and mental capabilities. If it does not assume the personality and mentality of a white dragon, it knows what it formerly knew as well.\n&emsp;The wizard can use a *dispel magic* spell to change the polymorphed creature back to its original form, and this requires a system shock roll. Those who have lost their individuality and are then converted back maintain the belief that they are actually the polymorphed creature and attempt to return to that form. Thus, the orc who comes to believe he is a white dragon, when converted back to his orc form, steadfastly maintains he is really a white dragon polymorphed into the shape of an orc. His companions will most likely consider him mad.'

Naturally, the strength of the new form is sufficient to enable normal movement. The spellcaster can change his form as often as desired for the duration of the spell, each change requiring a round. The wizard retains his own hit points, attack rolls, and saving throws. The wizard can end the spell at any time; when voluntarily returning to his own form and ending the spell, he regains 1d12 hit points.

Fire-using creatures suffer 3 points of damage per inch, while cold-using creatures suffer only 1 point of damage per inch when breaking through. The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored along one or more sides.\n&emsp;B) *Hemisphere.* This casting of the spell creates a hemisphere whose maximum radius is equal to 3 feet plus 1 foot per caster level ([[3+[[@{level-wizard}]] ]] foot radius). Thus, a 7th-level caster can create a hemisphere 10 feet in radius. The hemisphere lasts until it is broken, dispelled, or melted. Note that it is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents under the hemisphere.\n&emsp;C) *Ice sheet.* This casting of the spell causes a horizontal sheet to fall upon opponents. The sheet covers a 10-foot-square area per caster level ([[10*[[@{level-wizard}]] ]]-foot-square area). The sheet has the same effect as an ice storm’s hail stones—3d10 points of damage inflicted to creatures beneath it.\n&emsp;A wall of ice cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures; its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. Magical fires such as fireballs and fiery dragon breath melt a wall of ice in one round, though this creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts one turn. Normal fires or lesser magical ones do not hasten the melting of a wall of ice.'

If constructed of ivory, the metal fittings of the chest must be gold. If the chest is fashioned from bronze, copper, or silver, its fittings must be electrum or silver. The cost of such a chest is never less than 5,000 gp. Once it is constructed, the wizard must have a tiny replica (of the same materials and perfect in every detail) made, so that the miniature of the chest appears to be a perfect copy. One wizard can have but one pair of these chests at any given time—even *wish* spells do not allow exceptions! The chests themselves are nonmagical, and can be fitted with locks, wards, and so on, just as any normal chest.\n&emsp;While touching the chest and holding the tiny replica, the caster chants the spell. This causes the large chest to vanish into the Ethereal Plane. The chest can contain one cubic feet of material per level of the wizard no matter what its apparent size.

Living matter makes it 75% likely that the spell fails, so the chest is typically used for securing valuable spell books, magical items, gems, etc. As long as the spellcaster has the small duplicate of the magical chest, he can recall the large one from the Ethereal Plane whenever the chest is desired.

This chance is reset to 1% whenever the chest is recalled and the spell recast to return it to the Ethereal Plane. If the chest is found, the DM must work out the encounter and decide how the being reacts to the chest (for example, it might ignore the chest, fully or partially empty it, or even exchange or add to the items present!).\n&emsp;Whenever the secret chest is brought back to the Prime Material Plane, an ethereal window is opened for a variable amount of time (usually about one turn); the window slowly diminishes in size.

The special life force receptacle must be within spell range of the wizard’s body at the time of spellcasting. The wizard’s life force shifts into the receptacle in the round in which the casting is completed, allowing no other actions.\n&emsp;While in the magic jar, the caster can sense and attack any life force within a [[10*[[@{level-wizard}]] ]]-foot radius (on the same plane); however, the exact creature types and relative physical positions cannot be determined. In a group of life forces, the caster can sense a difference of four or more levels/Hit Dice and can determine whether a life force is positive or negative energy.\n&emsp;For example, if two 10th-level fighters are attacking a hill giant and four ogres, the caster could determine that there are three stronger and four weaker life forces within range, all with positive life energy. The caster could try to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature, but he has no control over exactly which creature is attacked.\n&emsp;An attempt to take over a host body requires a full round. It is blocked by a *protection from evil* spell or similar ward. It is successful only if the subject fails a saving throw vs. spell with a special modifier (see following).

Failure to take over the host leaves the wizard’s life force in the magic jar.\n&emsp;If successful, the caster’s life force occupies the host body and the host’s life force is confined in the magic jar receptacle. The caster can call upon rudimentary or instinctive knowledge of the subject creature, but not upon its real or acquired knowledge (i.e., the wizard does not automatically know the language or spells of the creature). The caster retains his own attack rolls, class knowledge and training, and any adjustments due to his Intelligence or Wisdom. If the host body is human or humanoid, and the necessary spell components are available, the wizard can even use his memorized spells. The host body retains its own hit points and physical abilities and properties. The DM decides if any additional modifications are necessary; for example, perhaps clumsiness or inefficiency occurs if the caster must become used to the new form. The alignment of the host or receptacle is that of the occupying life force.\n&emsp;The caster can shift freely from the host to the receptacle if within the [[10*[[@{level-wizard}]] ]]-foot range. Each attempt to shift requires one round. The spell ends when the wizard shifts from the jar to his own body.\n&emsp;A successful *dispel magic* spell cast on the host can drive the caster of the *magic jar* spell back into the receptacle and prevent him from making any attacks for 1d4 rounds plus 1 round per level of the caster of the dispel. The base success chance is 50%, plus or minus 5% per level difference between the casters. A successful *dispel magic* cast against the receptacle forces the occupant back into his own body. If the wizard who cast the *magic jar* is forced back into his own body, the spell ends.\n&emsp;If the host body is slain, the caster returns to the receptacle, if within range, and the life force of the host departs (i.e., it is dead). If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both the host and the caster die.\n&emsp;Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain unless recalled by a *raise dead, resurrection,* or similar spell.\n&emsp;If the body of the caster is slain, his life force survives if it is in either the receptacle or the host. If the receptacle is destroyed while the caster’s life force occupies it, the caster is irrevocably slain.'

    'effect': 'This spell creates an electrical discharge that begins as a single stroke of lightning, 2½ feet wide, commencing from the fingertips of the caster. Unlike a *lightning bolt* spell, chain lightning strikes one object or creature initially, then arcs to a series of other objects or creatures within range, losing energy with each jump.\n&emsp;The bolt initially inflicts 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster, to a maximum of 12d6 (half damage if the object or creature rolls a successful saving throw vs. spell). After the first strike, the lightning arcs to the next nearest object or creature. Each jump reduces the strength of the lightning by 1d6. Each creature or magical object hit receives a saving throw vs. spell. Success on this save indicates the creature suffers only half damage from the bolt.\n&emsp;The chain can strike as many times (including the first object or creature) as the spellcaster has levels, although each creature or object can be struck only once. Thus, a bolt cast by a 12th-level wizard can strike up to 12 times, causing less damage with each strike. The bolt continues to arc until it has struck the appropriate number of objects or creatures, until it strikes an object that grounds it (interconnecting iron bars of a large cell or cage, a large pool of liquid, etc.), or until there are no more objects or creatures to strike.\n&emsp;Direction is not a consideration when plotting chain lightning arcs. Distance is a factor—an arc cannot exceed the spell’s range. If the only possible arc is greater than the spell’s range, the stroke fades into nothingness. Creatures immune to electrical attack can be struck, even though no damage is taken. Note that it is possible for the chain to arc back to the caster!'

The item must meet the following tests: 1) it must be in sound and undamaged condition; 2) the item must be the finest possible, considering its nature, i.e., crafted of the highest quality material and with the finest workmanship; and 3) its cost or value must reflect the second test, and in most cases the item must have a raw-materials cost in excess of 100 gp. With respect to requirement 3, it is not possible to apply this test to items such as ropes, leather goods, cloth, and pottery not normally embroidered, bejeweled, tooled, carved, or engraved. If such work or materials can be added to an item without weakening or harming its normal functions, however, these are required for the item to be enchanted.\n&emsp;The wizard must have access to a workshop or laboratory, properly equipped and from which contaminating magic can be screened. Any magical item not related to the fabrication process (such as most protective devices) and within 30 feet of the materials is a source of contaminating magic and will spoil the process.\n&emsp;The item to be prepared must be touched by the spellcaster. This touching must be constant and continual during the casting time, which is a base 16 hours plus an additional 8d8 hours (current work time [[16+8d8]] hours) (as the wizard may never work more than eight hours per day, and haste or any other spells will not alter the time required in any way, this effectively means that casting time for this spell is two days + 1d8 days). All work must be uninterrupted, and during rest periods the item being enchanted must never be more than 1 foot distant from the spellcaster; if it is, the whole spell is spoiled and must be begun again. (Note that during rest periods absolutely no other form of magic can be performed, and the wizard must remain quiet and in isolation or the enchantment is ruined.)\n&emsp;At the end of the spell, the caster will know that the item is ready for the final test. He will then pronounce the final magical syllable, and if the item makes a saving throw (which is exactly the same as that of the wizard) vs. spell, the spell is completed. The spellcaster’s saving throw bonuses also apply to the item, up to +3. A result of 1 on the 1d20 roll always results in failure, regardless of modifications. Once the spell is finished, the wizard can begin to place the desired spell upon the item. The spell he plans to place must be cast within 24 hours or the preparatory spell fades, and the item must be enchanted again.\n&emsp;Each spell subsequently cast upon an object bearing an *enchant an item* spell requires 2d4 hours per spell level of the magic being cast. Again, during casting the item must be touched by the wizard, and during the rest periods it must always be within 1 foot of his person. This procedure holds true for any additional spells placed upon the item, and each successive spell must be begun within 24 hours of the last, even if the prior spell failed.\n&emsp;No magic placed on an item is permanent unless a *permanency* spell is used as a finishing touch. This always runs a 5% risk of draining 1 point of Constitution from the wizard casting the spell. Also, while it is possible to tell when the basic spell (*enchant an item*) succeeds, it is not possible to tell if successive castings actually work, for each must make the same sort of saving throw as the item itself made. Naturally, an item that is charged—a rod, staff, wand, *javelin of lightning, ring of wishes,* etc.—can never be made permanent. Magical devices cannot be used to enchant an item or cast magic upon an object so prepared, but scrolls can be used for this purpose.\n&emsp;The materials needed for this spell vary according to both the nature of the item being enchanted and the magic to be cast upon it. For example, a *cloak of displacement* might require the hides of one or more displacer beasts, a sword meant to slay dragons could require the blood and some other part of the type(s) of dragon(s) it will be effective against, and a *ring of shooting stars* might require pieces of meteorites and the horn of ki-rin. These specifics, as well as other information pertaining to this spell, are decided by the DM and must be discovered or researched in play.'

    'effect': 'Casting this spell attempts a dangerous act: to lure a powerful creature from another plane to a specifically prepared trap, where it will be held until it agrees to perform one service in return for freedom from the *ensnarement* spell. The type of creature to be ensnared must be known and stated, and if it has a specific, proper, or given name, this must be used in casting the *ensnarement* spell. The spell causes an awareness of a gatelike opening on the plane of the creature to be ensnared. A special saving throw is then made to determine if the creature detects the nature of the planar opening as a trap or believes it to be a gate. To save, the creature must roll equal to or less than its Intelligence score on 1d20. The score is modified by the difference between the creature’s Intelligence and that of the spellcaster. If the creature has a higher score, the difference is subtracted from its dice roll to save. If the spellcaster has a higher score, the difference is added to the dice roll.\n&emsp;If the saving throw succeeds, the creature ignores the spell-created opening, and the spell fails. If the saving throw fails, the creature steps into the opening and is ensnared.\n&emsp;When so trapped, the otherplanar creature can freely attack the ensnaring wizard, unless the caster has created a warding circle. Such circles may be temporary (drawn by hand) or permanent (inlaid or carved). Even with such protection, the entrapped creature may break free and wreak its vengeance upon the spellcaster.\n&emsp;A hand-drawn circle has a base failure chance of 20%, while one inlaid or carved has a base of 10% (and that is for the first time it is used, to determine whether or not the job was done properly). The base chance is modified by the difference between the wizard’s combined Intelligence and experience level ([[@{level-wizard}+@{Intelligence}]]) and the Intelligence and the experience level or Hit Dice of the creature ensnared. If the spellcaster has a higher total, that difference in percentage points is subtracted from the chance for the creature to break free. If the creature has a higher total, that difference is added to its chance to break free.\n&emsp;The chance can be further reduced by careful preparation of the circle. If the hand-made circle is drawn over a longer period of time, using specially prepared pigments (1,000 gp value per turn spent drawing), the chance of breaking free is reduced by 1% for every turn spent in preparation. This can bring the base chance to 0%. Similarly, an inlaid or carved design can be brought to a 0% chance of the creature breaking free by inlaying with various metals, minerals, etc. This cost will require a minimum of one full month of time and add not less than 50,000 gp to the basic cost of having the circle inlaid or carved into stone. Any break in the circle spoils the efficacy of the spell and enables the creature to break free automatically. Even a straw dropped across the line of a magic circle destroys its power. Fortunately, the creature within cannot so much as place a straw upon any portion of the inscribed ward, for the magic of the barrier absolutely prevents it.\n&emsp;Once safely ensnared, the creature can be kept for as long as the spellcaster dares. (Remember the danger of something breaking the ward!) The creature cannot leave the circle, nor can any of its attacks or powers penetrate the barrier. The caster can offer bribes, use promises, or make threats in order to exact one service from the captive creature.\n&emsp;The DM will then assign a value to what the wizard has said to the ensnared creature, rating it from 0 to 6 (with 6 being the most persuasive). This rating is then subtracted from the Intelligence score of the creature. If the creature rolls a successful Intelligence check against its adjusted Intelligence, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, etc., can be made, or the old ones re-offered 24 hours later, when the creature’s Intelligence has dropped by 1 point due to confinement. This can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until the caster decides to get rid of it by means of some riddance spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to.\n&emsp;Once the single service is completed, the creature need only so inform the spellcaster to be instantly sent from whence it came. The creature might later seek revenge.'

This gaze attack is in addition to any other attacks allowed to the wizard. The wizard selects one of four possible gaze attacks at the time the spell is cast, and this attack cannot be changed. For example, a 12th-level caster who chose *fear* would have four opportunities to make gaze attacks causing fear, one for each round of the spell’s duration. Any gaze attack is negated by a successful saving throw vs. spell, with Wisdom adjustments. The four effects of the spell are as follows:\n&emsp;*Charm:* The wizard can charm a single person or monster by gaze and by uttering a single word. The effect is to make the charmed subject absolutely loyal and docile to the caster, even to the point of personal danger. It is otherwise the same as a *charm monster* spell. All creatures other than humans, demihumans, and humanoids save with +2 bonuses.\n&emsp;*Fear:* The wizard can cause fear by gaze and by speaking a single  word. The subject flees in blind terror for 1d4 rounds. After this, the creature refuses to face the caster and cowers or bolts for the nearest cover if subsequently confronted by the caster (50% chance of either). The latter effect lasts one turn per caster level. This attack can be negated by spells that counter fear.\n&emsp;*Sicken:* This power enables the caster to merely gaze, speak a word, and cause sudden pain and fever to sweep over the subject’s body. Creatures with ability scores function at half effectiveness; others inflict only one-half damage with physical attacks. Movement is at one-half normal rate. The subject remains stricken for one turn per level of the caster, (Currently [[@{level-wizard}]] turns), after which all abilities return at the rate of one point per turn of complete rest or one point per hour of moderate activity. The effects cannot be negated by a *cure disease* or *heal* spell, but a *remove curse* or successful *dispel magic* spell is effective. Creatures other than humans, demihumans, and humanoids save with +2 bonuses versus this attack.\n&emsp;*Sleep:* The wizard can cause any individual to fall into a comatose slumber by means of a gaze and a single word, unless the subject successfully rolls its saving throw vs. spell. Creatures normally subject to a 1st-level *sleep* spell save with –2 penalties. An affected creature must be shaken or otherwise shocked back to consciousness.\n&emsp;In all cases, the gaze attack has a speed factor of 1. This spell does not affect undead of any type, or extend beyond the plane occupied by the caster. Note that the caster is subject to the effects of his reflected gaze and is allowed any applicable saving throw. In the case of a reflected *charm* gaze, the caster is paralyzed until it wears off or is countered.'

While a geas cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that are likely to result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of action. The geased creature must follow the given instructions until the geas is completed. Failure to do so will cause the creature to grow sick and die within 1d4 weeks. Deviation from or twisting of the instructions causes a corresponding loss of Strength points until the deviation ceases. A geas can be done away with by a *wish* spell, but a *dispel magic* or *remove curse* spell will not negate it. Your DM will decide any additional details of a geas, for its casting and fulfillment are tricky, and an improperly cast geas is ignored.'

It radiates magic, but when she used an *identify* spell, she could not learn any information. Even giving it to a trusted fighter didn’t work, as the sword did not reveal any special powers. Finally, she casts a *legend lore* spell, hoping to gain more information. Since the sword is at hand, she completes the spell in three turns. In her mind comes the message, “Once this was the sword of he who waits till Albion’s time of greatest peril, when unto his hand it shall fly again. Fair was the hand that gave me and fair was the hand that reclaimed me.” Clearly, Delsenora realizes, this must be a very powerful item, since her spell gave only a cryptic answer. But who is he who waits? And where is Albion? For more information, Delsenora is going to have to cast more spells. But now the process will take much longer, since she has only the vaguest of clues to follow.'

If the resistance check is successful, the creature escapes. If it fails, the creature is caged. Note that a successful check does not destroy the cage, nor does it enable other creatures (save familiars) to flee with the escaping creature. The forcecage is also unlike the solid-walled protective device, cube of force, in that it can be gotten rid of only by means of a *dispel magic* spell or by the expiration of the spell.\n&emsp;By means of special preparation at the time of memorization, a *forcecage* spell can be altered to a *forcecube* spell.

The wizard knows where he will come out on the Prime Material Plane.\n&emsp;The *shadow walk* spell can also be used to travel to other planes that border on the Demiplane of Shadow, but this requires the potentially perilous transit of the Demiplane of Shadow to arrive at a border with another plane of reality.\n&emsp;Any creatures touched by the wizard when *shadow walk* is cast also make the transition to the borders of the Demiplane of Shadow. They may opt to follow the wizard, wander off through the plane, or stumble back into the Prime Material Plane (50% chance for either result if they are lost or abandoned by the wizard). Creatures unwilling to accompany the wizard into the Demiplane of Shadow receive a saving throw, negating the effect if successful.'

The spell remains until the magical hedge is somehow broken.\n&emsp;*Metamorphosis:* Causes the subject to change to some noncorporeal form, save for its head or face. The binding is permanent until some prescribed act frees the subject.\n&emsp;*Minimus Containment:* The subject is shrunken to a height of 1 inch or even less and held within the hedged prison of some gem or similar object. The subject of a minimus containment, metamorphosis, or hedged prison radiates a very faint aura of magic.\n&emsp;The subject of the chaining form of the spell receives a saving throw with no modifications. However, slumber allows the subject a +1 bonus, bound slumber a +2 bonus, hedged prison a +3 bonus, metamorphosis a +4 bonus, and minimus containment a +5 bonus to the saving throw. If the subject is magically weakened, the DM can assign a –1, –2, or even –4 penalty to the saving throw. A successful saving throw enables the subject to burst its bonds and do as it pleases.\n&emsp;A *binding* spell can be renewed in the case of the first three forms of the spell, for the subject does not have the opportunity to break the bonds. (If anything has caused a weakening of a chaining or slumber version, such as attempts to contact the subject or magically touch it, a normal saving throw applies to the renewal of the spell.) Otherwise, after one year, and each year thereafter, the subject gains a normal saving throw vs. the spell. Whenever it is successful, the *binding* spell is broken and the creature is free.'

Other changes like-wise affect spell duration. Thus, changing a lion to an androsphinx would be permanent, but turning a turnip to a purple worm would be a change with a duration measured in hours. Turning a tusk into an elephant would be permanent, but turning a twig into a sword would be a change with a duration of several turns.\n&emsp;All polymorphed objects radiate a strong magic, and if a *dispel magic* spell is successfully cast upon them, they return to their natural form. Note that a *stone to flesh* spell or its reverse will affect objects under this spell. As with other polymorph spells, damage sustained in the new form can result in the injury or death of the polymorphed creature.\n&emsp;For example, it is possible to polymorph a creature into rock and grind it to dust, causing damage, perhaps even death. If the creature was changed to dust to start with, more creative methods to damage it would be needed; perhaps the wizard could use a *gust of wind* spell to scatter the dust far and wide. In general, damage occurs when the new form is altered through physical force, although the DM will have to adjudicate many of these situations.\n&emsp;The system shock roll must be applied to living creatures, as must the restrictions noted regarding the *polymorph other* and *stone to flesh* spells. Also note that a polymorph effect often detracts from an item’s or creature’s powers, but does not add new powers, except possibly movement capabilities not present in the old form. Thus, a *vorpal sword* polymorphed into a dagger would not retain vorpal capability. Likewise, valueless items cannot be made into permanent valuable items.'

If the caster proceeds with the spell (into the next round), the subject begins to sink slowly into the ground. Before any actions are taken in the new round, the subject sinks one-quarter of its height; after the first group acts, another quarter; after the second group acts, another; and at the end of the round, the victim is totally sunken into the ground.\n&emsp;This entombment places a creature or object in a state of suspended animation. The cessation of time means that the subject does not grow older. Bodily and other functions virtually cease, but the subject is otherwise unharmed. The subject exists in undamaged form in the surface into which it was sunk, its upper point as far beneath the surface as the subject has height—a 6-foot-tall victim will be 6 feet beneath the surface, while a 60-foot-tall subject will have its uppermost point 60 feet below ground level.

Spells such as *dig, transmute rock to mud,* and *freedom* (the reverse of the 9th-level spell *imprisonment*) will not harm the sunken creature or object and will often be helpful in recovering it. If a *detect magic* spell is cast over an area upon which a *sink* spell was used, it reveals a faint magical aura of undefinable nature, even if the subject is beyond detection range.

The creature must be seen by the caster when the final word is uttered.\n&emsp;The spell can be triggered in one of two ways. First, the final word of the spell can be spoken when the creature is within spell range. This allows magic resistance (if any) and a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. If the creature’s real name is spoken as well, any magic resistance is ignored and the saving throw vs. spell suffers a penalty of –2. If the saving throw is successful, the prison gem shatters.\n&emsp;The second method is far more insidious, for it tricks the victim into accepting a trigger object inscribed with the final spell word, automatically placing the creature’s soul in the trap. To use this method, both the creature’s true name and the trigger word must be inscribed on the trigger item when the gem is enchanted. A *sympathy* spell can also be placed on the trigger item. As soon as the subject creature picks up or accepts the trigger item, its life force is automatically transferred to the gem, without the benefit of magic resistance or saving throw.\n&emsp;The gem prison will hold the trapped entity indefinitely, or until the gem is broken and the life force is released, allowing the material body to reform. If the trapped creature is a powerful creature from another plane (which could mean a character trapped by an inhabitant of another plane when the character is not on the Prime Material Plane), it can be required to perform a service immediately upon being freed. Otherwise, the creature can go free once the gem imprisoning it is broken.\n&emsp;Before the actual casting of the *trap the soul* spell, the wizard must prepare the prison, a gem of at least 1,000 gp value for every Hit Die or level of experience possessed by the creature to be trapped (for example, it requires a gem of 10,000 gp value to trap a 10 Hit Die or 10th-level creature). If the gem is not valuable enough, it shatters when the entrapment is attempted. (Note that while characters have no concept of level as such, the value of the gem needed to trap an individual can be researched. Remember that this value can change over time as characters advance.) Creating the prison gem requires an *enchant an item* spell and the placement of a *maze* spell into the gem, thereby forming the prison to contain the life force.'

Only magical items can be brought into the Astral Plane (although nonmagical items could be rendered temporarily magical through the use of some spells, if the DM allows). As the Astral Plane touches upon the first levels of all of the Outer Planes, the wizard can travel astrally to any of the Outer Planes at will. The caster then leaves the Astral Plane, forming a body in the plane of existence he has chosen to enter. It is also possible to travel astrally anywhere in the Prime Material Plane by means of the *astral spell,* but a second body cannot be formed in the Prime Material Plane. As a general rule, a person astrally projected can be seen only by creatures in the Astral Plane.\n&emsp;At all times, the astral body is connected to the material body by a silvery cord. If the cord is broken, the affected person is killed, astrally and materially; however, normally only a psychic wind can cause the cord to break. When a second body is formed in a different plane, the silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new body. If the astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to the original body where it rests in the Prime Material Plane, reviving it from its state of suspended animation.\n&emsp;Although astrally projected persons are able to function in the Astral Plane, their actions do not affect creatures not existing in the Astral Plane. The spell lasts until the wizard desires to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means (such as a *dispel magic* spell or the destruction of the wizard’s body in the Prime Material Plane).\n&emsp;The wizard can project the astral forms of up to seven other creatures with him by means of the *astral spell,* providing the creatures are linked in a circle with the wizard. These fellow travelers are dependent upon the wizard and can be stranded. Travel in the Astral Plane can be slow or fast, according to the wizard’s desire. The ultimate destination arrived at is subject to the conceptualization of the wizard. (See the *Planescape Campaign Setting* boxed set for further information on the Astral Plane.)\n&emsp;Any magical items can go into the Astral Plane, but most become temporarily nonmagical therein, or in any planes removed from the Prime Material Plane. Armor and weapons of +3 or better might function in other planes, at the DM’s option. Artifacts and relics function anywhere. Items drawing their power from a given plane are more powerful in that plane (for example, a *ring of fire resistance* in the Elemental Plane of Fire or a *sword of life stealing* in the Negative Energy plane).'

The spellcaster becomes the creature he wishes, and has all of its abilities save those dependent upon Intelligence, innate magical abilities, and magic resistance, for the mind of the creature is that of the spellcaster. Thus, he can change into a griffon and fly away, then to an efreet and fly through a roaring flame, then to a titan to lift up a wagon, etc. These creatures have whatever hit points the wizard had at the time of the shape change. Each alteration in form requires only a second, and no system shock is incurred.\n&emsp;For example, a wizard is in combat and assumes the form of a will o’ wisp. When this form is no longer useful, the wizard changes into a stone golem and walks away. When pursued, the golem-shape is changed to that of a flea, which hides on a horse until it can hop off and become a bush. If detected as the latter, the wizard can become a dragon, an ant, or just about anything he is familiar with.\n&emsp;A wizard adopting another form also adopts its vulnerabilities. For example, a wizard who becomes a spectre is powerless in daylight, and is subject to being turned, controlled, or destroyed by opposing clerics. Unlike similar spells, a wizard who is killed in another form does not revert to his original shape, which may disallow certain types of revivification.\n&emsp;The material component is a jade circlet worth no less than 5,000 gp, which shatters at the end of the spell’s duration.

Actual combat must then take place, for no magical means of escape is possible. The foe fought is real for all intents and purposes; affected creatures that lose will die. If a creature’s phantasmal nemesis from the *weird* spell is slain, the creature emerges with no damage, no loss of items seemingly used in the combat, and no loss of spells likewise seemingly expended.

Other forms of wishes, however, cause the spellcaster to weaken (–3 on Strength) and require 2d4 days of bed rest due to the stresses the *wish* places upon time, space, and his body. Regardless of what is wished for, the exact terminology of the *wish* spell is likely to be carried out.

    'effect': 'Hornung, one of the leading wizards in the field of wild magic (before his untimely disappearance while experimenting with *wildwind*), developed this spell to improve the accuracy of his estimates. The spell provides a wizard with an instant and highly accurate estimate of the number of persons or objects in a group.\n&emsp;The spell’s area of effect is one group of a general class of objects. All objects of the group must be within spell range and the group as a whole must be visible to the caster. The wizard need not see every individual in the group, merely the general limits of the group’s size and area. For example, a wizard on a hill could look down on a forest and estimate the number of trees in all or part of it. He could not get an estimate of the number of goblins within the forest, however, since the group as a whole (the goblins) is concealed from sight.\n&emsp;The estimate generated is accurate to the largest factor of ten (rounded up). For example, if *Hornung’s guess* were cast on a group of 439 horsemen, the estimate would be 400. If there were 2,670 horsemen, the spell would estimate 3,000. If there were 37 horsemen, the answer would be 40. Clearly, using the spell on small groups (especially those with fewer than 10 members) is pointless.\n&emsp;*Hornung’s guess* can be used to quickly estimate the size of treasure hoards and army units. It is particularly popular with moneylenders and generals.'

Fortunately, the creature cannot take any action against any portion of the ward, for the magic of the barrier absolutely prevents this.\n&emsp;Once safely ensnared, the lycanthrope can be held for as long as the summoner dares. The creature cannot leave the circle, nor can any of its attacks or powers penetrate the magical barrier. When the full moon sets, the lycanthrope reverts to its human form.

The spell can be cast only upon nonliving objects and can affect only materials within a 10’×10’×10’ cube.\n&emsp;Objects in the area of effect either remain normal and visible or they disappear (50% chance). The state of existence for any object is determined randomly and changes with each viewing and viewer. Thus, a single object could appear and disappear several times during the course of the spell. Furthermore, it might be “there” for one onlooker, but “not there” for another.\n&emsp;For example, a wild mage casts this spell on a doorway. The DM rolls percentile dice and determines the door is “there” for the wizard. The wizard’s companion also looks at the door. The DM rolls and determines that the door is “not there” for the companion. The pair studies the door for several minutes, during which time the door does not change (this counts as a single viewing for each character).\n&emsp;The wizard and his companion then close their eyes. When they look at the door again, new checks for each character reveal the door is “not there” for both characters. The pair steps through the open archway and turns around to look at the door once again. This time it is “not there” for the wizard, but “there” for his companion. This random changing continues throughout the duration of the spell.\n&emsp;Objects that are “there” are normal in all respects. Doors can be opened, chests can be picked up and carried, and rocks can be used as barricades. Objects that are “not there” are gone, although their absence does not cause ceilings to collapse or other damage. A wizard could walk through a “not there” wall without difficulty.\n&emsp;When two parties perceive a *there/not there* object differently, the object functions for each party according to its own perceptions. For example, a wizard hides behind a rock that he sees as “there.” Her enemy, a fighter, perceives the rock as “not there” and fires arrows at the wizard. The wizard would perceive the arrows as bouncing off the rock, while the fighter would perceive the arrows as missing their target or falling short. The fighter would be subject to a check before firing each arrow to determine whether his perception changes (assume that the fighter must look away from the rock every time he nocks an arrow; each time he takes aim, this counts as a new viewing).\n&emsp;After the spell is cast, any objects removed from the area of effect retain their uncertain existence for the duration of the spell. Thus, a pair of heroes could pick up a treasure chest, carry it down the hall, set it down, and discover it had vanished while their backs were turned. Worse still, one might see the chest and the other not!'

The spell affects a quantity of liquid no larger than the area of effect. If cast onto a larger body, such as an ocean or large lake, the spell affects only the water within the area of effect.\n&emsp;After casting *waveform*, the mage can form the water into any desired shape. The spell does not bind the liquid together in any fashion; it is still limited by its fluid properties and gravity. Thus, a mage could not use *waveform* to create a humanoid creature with arms and legs and direct it to walk across land. He could, however, create a roughly human shape with flowing arms that rises out of the water, crashes forward in a huge splash, then rises and repeats the process. Other possible shapes include gigantic waves, geysers, whirlpools, and troughs.\n&emsp;The shape takes one round to form, after which it can be maintained by concentration. The shape can be directed to move in any direction at the rate of 90 feet per round. If the *waveform* moves into or through a body of water, the form loses no intensity. However, if the wave is moved over dry ground, it loses one die of damage for every 10 feet crossed.\n&emsp;If propelled against a target, the *waveform* causes 1d4 points of damage per level of the caster to creatures in its path. The *waveform* can be directed against creatures on the surface or underwater. Those struck are allowed a saving throw; success indicates half damage.\n&emsp;If the victims are in or on a body of water, the shape will sweep them along. Creatures of small size are carried with the form, moving at its speed. Medium and large size creatures are swept along at half the water’s speed. Creatures larger than this resist the movement. Those caught in the current can make a Strength check each round to swim free of the current.\n&emsp;Boats and ships are particularly vulnerable to the *waveform*. If the *waveform* is twice the size of the vessel or more, the ship must make a seaworthiness check (as described in Table 77 of the *DMG*). Vessels passing the check suffer damage as described above, reducing seaworthiness ratings for future checks by 2d6 points until repairs are made.\n&emsp;Alternatively, this spell can be cast directly at a single water-based creature—a water weird, water elemental, or other creature from the elemental plane of water. In this case, the spell causes 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster. The effect is instantaneous and the spell ends immediately after the attack is made.'

The wild mage can then choose to let the energy dissipate or he can instantly use it to cast a spell back at the opposing mage. The return spell must be of an equal or lesser spell level than the original one and must be currently memorized by the mage. The act of returning the spell does not cost the wild mage any of his memorized spells. Spell energy cannot be saved; if not used immediately, it dissipates.\n&emsp;For example, Hamos, a wild mage, is protected by a *spell shape* and is struck by a *finger of death* (a 7th-level spell). He succeeds at his saving throw and is now able to cast a spell of 7th level or lower. Hamos currently has *feeblemind* memorized. Since it is only a 5th-level spell, he chooses to cast it back at his enemy. He makes his level variation check (and doesn’t get a wild surge) and the *feeblemind* is sent hurtling back at his foe. Hamos still has his original *feeblemind* memorized. The remaining two spell levels are lost, since they were not used in the same round.\n&emsp;If a wild mage is struck by two spells at once, he may choose which spell to shape. He suffers all effects of the remaining spell.'

Animal zombies conform to the statistics for the particular animal that has been animated, with the following changes: the animal’s number of hit dice is increased by one, AC is worsened by three (AC 8 maximum), and movement is reduced by half.\n&emsp;Skeletal and zombie animals gain the standard undead immunities (resistance to cold-based, *sleep*, *charm*, and *hold* spells), but lose any normal defenses that the living animal might have had. They also lose any special attacks (raking of rear claws, swallowing whole, and so on) and cannot inject poison or emit fluids, such as musk or saliva. Swallowing does no further damage to the creature swallowed, except to trap it within the swallower’s rib cage. Priests gain a +1 bonus when turning these undead.\n&emsp;This spell is often a necromancer’s first experience animating corpses. For this to work, the animal bodies or skeletons must be intact.'

This link allows the caster to gather sensory information from the vicinity of the cadaver or undead being. For every three levels of experience past the 1st, the wizard gains the ability to collect information from an additional sense via the corpse link. Currently up to [[{1+floor(([[@{level-wizard}]]-1)/3),5}kl1]] senses. At 4th level, for instance, the wizard may choose up to two senses (up to three at 7th level, four at 10th level, and all five at 13th level).\n&emsp;*Sight:* The caster can see what the corpse or undead creature sees as if looking through one of the creature’s eyes.\n&emsp;*Sound:* The wizard can now hear through one ear, exactly as if standing at the corpse’s current location (if a wizard/thief, the caster can use his or her hear noise ability too).\n&emsp;*Smell:* With one nostril, the wizard can now smell things exactly as if standing at the corpse’s current location. The spell conveniently masks the putrefying stench of the cadaver (if any) so that subtle variations of aroma (like the scent of a rose) can easily be detected.\n&emsp;*Taste:* The caster can taste any substance which is introduced into the corpse’s mouth. The substance (which may be solid or liquid) tastes exactly as if the wizard had placed it on one side of his or her own tongue. This can be especially useful when checking for poison in food or *identifying* unknown potions. Thankfully, the taste of the corpse’s own rotting flesh can be masked out by the spell.\n&emsp;*Touch:* The caster gains the ability to sense the textural and environmental conditions, with a single hand, as if standing at the corpse’s location. The wizard can gauge the surface texture and temperature of any object or substance which is placed in contact with the corresponding hand of the corpse.\n&emsp;The type and number of sensory signals is chosen by the wizard at the time of casting, and cannot be changed for the duration of the spell. The caster collects all the sensory information through a single organ (eye, ear, nostril, half of the tongue, or hand) belonging to the corpse or undead recipient. *This organ need not be attached to the rest of the cadaver for the spell to function properly*.\n&emsp;While the spell is in effect, the wizard can still see/hear/smell/taste/touch normally through other (unlinked) organs. For example, a necromancer harvests the left eye from a fresh cadaver (with a successful Anatomy ability check) and places it on a high ledge, with a strategic view of a front door. If the spell is now cast, the wizard’s left eye would be able to see through the left eye of the corpse and spy on any visitors, while his or her right eye remains normal.\n&emsp;Furthermore, if the target of the spell is a zombie, the magic enables the caster to issue simple commands to the undead creature via this link. The commands can be no longer than four words and can deal only with the creature’s movement (turn left, walk forward two steps, and so on) If either the caster or the undead creature moves beyond the range of the spell, the effects are negated. *Corpse link* does not impart any animation to dead tissue; if cast on a regular cadaver, it remains stationary for the duration of the spell.'

In the short term (starting at the moment of casting up to the first full day), the bones of the victim become embrittled, greatly increasing his or her susceptibility to crushing attacks or falling damage.

All attacks by piercing and slashing weapons inflict double normal damage, while crushing attacks inflict quadruple damage. By the end of this period, the creature’s hit points are reduced by 60%. In the terminal stage of this spell, a victim’s bones finally dissolve, collapsing the subject’s spine and skull, bringing a slow and painful death.\n&emsp;While under the effects of this spell, the victim’s body is unable to undergo normal healing processes. Magical healing (spells or potions) slows the onset of the terminal stage, but it cannot halt the bone loss process completely. Every 10 hp of magical healing effectively prolongs the victim’s life in the intermediate stage of the affliction for one full day. The slow dissolution of bone can only be halted by a successful *dispel magic* or by *remove curse*, *cure disease*, *limited wish*, *wish*, *heal*, or *restoration* spells. Once the spell has been broken, lost hit points can be healed by normal or magical means.\n&emsp;The reverse of the spell, *bone growth*, immediately halts the *bone blight* and slowly (over a period of 1–6 days) restores all damage caused by that spell. *Bone growth* can also be used to fuse normal fractures by accelerating the recipient’s normal healing processes. Mild compression fractures heal in a day, while more serious ruptures (such as a broken leg or back) might take 1–4 days to fuse (assuming complete bed rest for the patient; otherwise healing time is doubled). This spell does not affect wounds or soft tissue damage, including cuts and sprains, nor does it correct for improper alignment of the bones while healing.\n&emsp;Both versions of this spell only work on living creatures and have no effect if cast on undead.'

Currently up to [[5*[[@{level-wizard}]] ]] miles away. While animated by the host’s life force, the corpse ceases to decay; however, unless illusionary magic is cast upon it, the cadaver will appear to be a form of undead (such a ju-ju zombie).\n&emsp;The recipient (who may be the caster) can see, hear, and sense through the corpse host. The host can fight, talk hoarsely (with the voice of the corpse), and carry things—in fact, it can perform all tasks less exacting than lock-picking, sewing, and similar handicrafts. It can even go adventuring and earn experience points for its “master.”\n&emsp;The recipient’s mind functions in two places simultaneously—within the corpse host and within his or her real body. The real body can still sense (see, hear, and so on) exactly as before, even benefiting from enhancements such as a magical ring. The tradeoff is paralysis. Aside from breathing, blinking, and moving his or her eyes, the recipient cannot move his or her real body while the host is animated. (Friendly guards are a wise precaution. So is a pleasant or strategic view). The real body does not need to eat, drink, or sleep.\n&emsp;The recipient is vulnerable when his or her corpse host is the target of magical and psionic powers that affect the mind. The host can be fooled by illusion spells to the same degree as the recipient. It works this way because both recipient and host are actually sharing the same mind.\n&emsp;Physical attacks against the corpse host don’t damage the real body, though they do harm the host. The latter has a number of “hit points” equal to the recipient’s normal maximum (even if the recipient is currently crippled). The host has the recipient’s natural armor class (10), though it may wear armor and employ weaponry with the same restrictions that apply to the recipient. The host does not benefit from anything worn or carried by the recipient’s real body, however.\n&emsp;The corpse host can withstand attacks as well as (or as poorly as) the recipient can normally. Note that since the host is not undead, it may not be turned or affected with spells or magical items that influence such creatures.\n&emsp;If the host drops to 0 or fewer hit points, the owner must make a system shock roll. Failure indicates that the real body also dies along with the host. The spiritual link between the recipient and host can also be abruptly severed by (successfully) casting the wizard spells *dispel magic*, *limited wish* or *wish* or by employing the clerical spells *spirit release* or *dispel evil*. Severance of the spiritual link also requires the recipient to make a system shock roll in order to survive the ordeal.\n&emsp;The recipient of this spell can abandon the link with the *corpse host* at any time, with no harm to him- or herself. The host immediately collapses (resuming its usual decay), and the recipient immediately regains control of his or her real body. The same thing occurs when the spell ends or the *corpse host* somehow moves beyond the spell’s range or to another plane.\n&emsp;Harvesting the piece of flesh from the recipient’s at the time of casting also inflicts 1–3 hit points of damage. At the conclusion of the spell, the recipient is entitled to a saving throw vs. death magic. If failed, the hit point loss is permanent (consumed by the spell) and cannot be reversed or magically healed except with a *wish* or *restoration* spell.

A *dispel magic* or *remove curse* may be effective, but only if cast within three rounds of the touch that confers the *ghoul gauntlet*. During the early stages of the spell, the original afflicted extremity may be severed and burned to terminate the spell.\n&emsp;If the extremity affected by the *ghoul gauntlet* is amputated while the victim has lost less than 20% of his or her total hit points, then only a hand or a foot may need to be severed (inflicting 1d4+1 hp of damage, requiring a system shock roll to remain conscious, and resulting in the loss of the limb’s mobility and functions). After the victim has lost 20%–50% of his or her hit points, however, an entire limb will have to be cut off, with the loss of 1d12+4 hp and a system shock roll. Initially, the transformed flesh of the victim has no paralytic powers or any of the special abilities associated with ghouls. As the spell unfolds, the advancing front of dying flesh inexorably traverses the entire body, and the victim immediately dies once the *ghoul gauntlet* reaches the heart or brain (upon reaching 0 hp due to the spell). Healing spells, potions, or magical items have no power to cure or reverse this affliction while the *ghoul gauntlet* runs its course.\n&emsp;One full day after the victim has died (unless the remains are burned), the subject awakens as a full-fledged ghoul as outlined in the *MONSTROUS MANUAL*.

If failed, the recipient gains the wounds of the disabled creature, subject to a few limitations.\n&emsp;The total amount of transferred hit points is limited to the caster’s current hit points (or 3 hp per level, whichever is *smaller*). Normally, the spell functions by conveying the wounds from the disabled creature to the caster (during the first round of casting) and then from the caster to the final recipient (during the second round of the spell). Should an conferred disability drain the wizard below zero hit points (if the wizard unwittingly attempts to channel more hit points than he or she currently possesses), the exchange effectively backfires and now operates on the wizard himself as an *empathic wound transfer*. The spell also backfires if it is interrupted during the second round of casting, before the final conferral of life force to the recipient.\n&emsp;At the DM’s discretion, this spell will never backfire when employed by a necromancer, who is presumably an expert in these rites.

The wizard may pronounce this short (single segment) syllable at any later time, casting his or her life force into the receptacle—providing that it lies within range. Obviously, this strategy only works if the receptacle is kept close to the wizard at all times. Furthermore, the wizard usually must leave behind clues or encrypted instructions so that his or her allies may later reverse the spell and restore the wizard to his or her normal state, whatever that may be. While the spell is in its unfinished state, the wizard cannot learn a new 8th-level spell to replace it. Aside from this limitation, however, the caster remains unaffected by the pending spell.\n&emsp;Less scrupulous wizards may use this rite to permanently transfer the recipient’s life force (often their own) into the body of a younger individual, thereby extending their own existence. The victim is entitled to a saving throw vs. death magic with a –4 penalty to resist the effects. If failed, the subject’s life force departs (resulting in the death of the victim), and the recipient’s life force takes permanent possession of the victim’s body. If the saving throw is successful, the spell fails without any ill effect to either the victim or recipient (though it may be recast at a later date). Thus, an ancient necromancer may transfer his or her life force into the body of a vigorous, younger person, thereby gaining all of the victim’s physical attributes, manual skills, hit points, and extended life span.\n&emsp;This spell cannot be dispelled normally (even in its “pending” state). If the receptacle was not sealed with a *permanency*, then the subject’s life force may be driven out with *spirit release* or *dispel evil* (in the event of a permanent magical receptacle, the item’s *permanency* must be first overcome with *dispel magic*).\n&emsp;In rare cases, to be adjudicated by the DM, the life force of the victim does not depart from the body, but coexists in his or her body with that of the recipient or “intruder.” Such a life force may be able to take control of the survivor—use the control rules for the *magic jar* spell to determine this. As before, the “intruder” life force can only be ejected by casting *spirit release* or *dispel evil* (or a full *wish*). Otherwise, at the discretion of the DM, the life force of the “intruder” merges with that of the victim, diluting the recipient’s personality, alignment, and possibly sanity, as well.\n&emsp;The reverse of this spell, *revoke life force transfer*, requires the original scroll (the one used in the *life force transfer* spell to be revoked), the construct, and the body of the recipient. Providing that the spell is cast before the body physically dies (within 2–7 days of the original separation), the reversal process requires a system shock roll in order to be successful. If failed (or if the body has already perished), the newly released life force dissipates, and the subject dies.'

    'effect': 'By covering a doorway with the most forbidden and lethal of necromantic runes, a wizard can protect a small portal so that any creature that tries to pass through the warded area without first speaking a word of command is immediately subjected to a modified *death spell*. A *death ward* may also be cast on an item (usually a spell book or phylactery) or on a tunnel or cave entrance no larger than 30 feet in diameter. A single application of this spell can kill up to twice as many hit dice or levels of creatures as the wizard who cast the spell has levels of experience (thus a 20th-level wizard can slay up to 40 levels with a single *death ward*). Currently up to [[2*[[@{level-wizard}]] ]] levels or hit dice.\n&emsp;Each creature passing through the ward is entitled to a saving throw vs. death magic with a –4 penalty; if successful, the individual survives and the ward loses none of its lethality. However, those who fail their saves are immediately slain (as per a *death spell*) and their levels or hit dice are subtracted from the potency of the ward. Those with greater hit dice than the current power of the *death ward* are unaffected by the spell.\n&emsp;For example, an 18th-level lich has cast the *death ward* (which can slay up to 36 levels) on the entrance to her inner sanctum. A party of four characters, each 15th level, enter her lair and foolishly traverse the warding. The first member fails his save and perishes, reducing the ward’s effectiveness to 21 levels. The second character makes her save and thus escapes any ill effects (the ward remains unaffected, however). The third character fails the save and dies also, reducing the ward to 6 levels of potency. The fourth 15th-level character has too many levels of experience to be affected by the weakened ward, which remains in effect until drained by a less powerful being.\n&emsp;Despite its lethality, this is not a subtle warding. The protected area or object is literally covered with intricate, arcane runes and symbols at the time of casting. These glyphs may flash ominously with pale red or blue light when approached within 10 feet. The entire area radiates a magical aura of lethal necromancy. Provided that he or she is on the same plane of existence, the caster will be immediately aware if the *death ward* has been triggered. By concentrating, the wizard who cast the ward may determine its current level of lethality, regardless of distance.\n&emsp;This terrible spell is a closely held secret, guarded jealously by the most powerful and black-hearted of necromancers and liches. It was originally designed by liches, as they can easily sustain the rigors of casting such a spell.\n&emsp;Mortal wizards who employ this powerful spell have a 25% chance of going insane (as per the *contact other plane* spell), contracting permanent paralysis (via a stroke), or suffering from a terminal illness (as per the *cause disease* spell) as adjudicated by the DM. The danger of misfortune is reduced by 5% for every point by which the mortal wizard’s Intelligence is above 18, though this modified chance never drops below 5%. Curiously, the mental stability afforded by lichdom makes these undying wizards completely immune to the dangers of employing this ward. It is similarly rumored that certain ancient, evil dragons have developed an even more potent version of this spell, which they may employ in their lairs with impunity.\n&emsp;The material component is a magical ink fabricated exclusively for this spell. The list of the ink’s noxious ingredients is lengthy and complex, but it includes the venom of numerous poisonous animals and the acrid ichor of extraplanar fiends. Not surprisingly, the accumulation of these deadly components and the subsequent fabrication of the baneful ink itself sometimes results in tragedy for a mortal wizard, as mentioned previously.\n&emsp;While the inscription process (the actual casting) of the *death ward* takes only 1 turn, the fabrication process of the ink (once the proper ingredients have been assembled) takes 1–4 days. The ink also requires the dust of powdered perdiots and garnets, worth between 2,000–8,000 gp. '

If only one target of the spell fails the save, then the one who made the saving throw is automatically stunned (reeling and unable to take action) for 1 round. Meanwhile the other subject (the one who failed the save) is stunned for 1–4 rounds.\n&emsp;In the event of a successful transfer, both life forces retain all of their original mental abilities and behavioral patterns, although their physical abilities are limited (or possibly enhanced) by their new forms. For instance, a decrepit necromancer uses this spell to exchange life forces with a hale, young warrior in the prime of his health. While the wizard gains a young and vigorous body (and all of the benefits that go with it), the unfortunate youth finds himself trapped in the withered shell of a dying, old man. Creatures unaccustomed to being shifted in this way are stunned for a minimum of 1 round after the transfer.\n&emsp;The effects of this spell are permanent and can only be reversed by a full *wish* or by the reverse of the spell, *revoke life force exchange*. If one of the bodies is slain before reversal can take place, the life force currently inhabiting that body departs. That spirit and its new body are dead just as if the spirit was in the body that actually belonged to it in the first place. The life force originally belonging to the slain body is now irreversibly trapped in its new form. Short of expending two *wishes* (one to restore the slain body, and the second to transfer the life force), the only way to now restore the victim to his or her rightful body is by *cloning* the original body and casting *revoke life force exchange*.'

It is an extension of him and possesses all of his physical and mental skills but not his magical abilities. (In other words, it moves, sounds, and fights just as he does but cannot cast spells.) The ninja sees through both sets of eyes at once. When the *shadow-form* is waiting or resting, the ninja can take actions on his own, but he cannot make both his real body and his *shadow-form* act at the same time.\n&emsp;If the *shadow-form* is hit in combat or struck with a *dispel magic* spell, it disappears—leaving behind all the clothing and equipment it was carrying. Also left behind is a handful of leaves inside the clothes, all that remains of the insubstantial body.\n&emsp;Spirit Warriors and spellcasting shinobi use this spell to perform particularly frightening short-term assignments. The *shadow-form* may be sent off to attack someone, to deliver a message, to scout a dangerous area, or to undertake any sort of action in which the ninja cannot afford to be caught. Usually the spellcaster dresses in a ninja night-suit before casting this spell, so that it is not readily obvious that the person within the clothing is transparent. When the *shadow-form* wears a night-suit and moves around in the dark, it is difficult to see that it is not a physical being.'

Each of the eyes is about the size of a small apple and can see 120 feet (normal vision only) in all directions. In order to report their findings, the eyes must return to the caster’s hand to replay in the caster’s mind everything they have seen during their existence. The eyes are subject to illusions, darkness, fog, and any other factors that would affect the wizard’s ability to receive visual information about his surroundings. The eyes only see as a normal human would—abilities and spell effects including infravision do not alter the eyes’ vision. It only takes the eye one round to replay one hour of recorded images.\n&emsp;The spell conjures 1d4 eyes, plus 1 eye per caster level. The eyes exist for up to 1 hour per caster level, or until they return to the wizard; after relaying its findings, an eye disappears. Each eye is AC 4, flies by levitation at a rate of 12, and has only 1 hit point—a single hit from any weapon or damaging spell destroys it. A successful *dispel magic* destroys all eyes caught in the area of effect. While the individual eyes are quite fragile, they’re small and difficult to spot, especially in conditions of poor visibility such as darkness, fog, or rain. Of course, if the eye is being sent into darkness, then it’s very possible that it could hit a wall or other similar obstacle and destroy itself.\n&emsp;When the wizard creates the eyes, he can specify any set of instructions or orders that he wishes, up to 25 words. Any knowledge the wizard possesses is assumed to be known by the eyes as well, so if the wizard knows what a typical Jakallian merchant looks like, the eyes do as well. Sample commands might be, “Surround me at a range of 400 yards and return if you spot any dangerous creatures,” or “Spread out and search the town for Arweth; follow him for three turns, staying out of sight, and then return.” Note that in the first command, the eye only returns if it spots a creature that the wizard would regard as dangerous; a seemingly innocuous peasant that is actually a *shapechanged* dragon wouldn’t trigger the eye’s return. In any event, if an eye is ever more than one mile distant from the wizard, it instantly ceases to exist. However, the wizard’s link with the eye is such that he won’t know if the eye was destroyed or if it just wandered out of range.\n&emsp;Some command words can be used to abbreviate the directions. For example, “surround me” directs the eyes to form an equally-spaced ring at whatever range is indicated, and then move with the wizard. As eyes return or are destroyed, the rest automatically space themselves to compensate. “Spread out” directs the eyes to move away from the wizard in all directions. Other commands that might be useful include having them form a line in a certain manner, making them move at random within a certain range, or have them follow a certain type of creature. The DM is the final judge of the suitability of the wizard’s directions.'

Monsters with thick or toughened hides, such as dragons, may lose part of the Armor Class at the DM’s discretion.

The effects vary by the proximity of the metal objects to the center of magnetism, as shown below:}}{{style=center sheet-spell-left1}}{{cc1-1=bottom}}{{cc1-3=bottom}}{{c1-1=**Distance to**\n**Magnetism**}}{{c2-1=10 feet or less}}{{c3-1=20 feet or less}}{{c4-1=30 feet or less}}{{c5-1=40 feet or less}}{{c6-1=50 feet or less}}{{c7-1=60 feet or less}}{{c1-2=**Movement Rate**\n**per Round**}}{{c2-2=40 feet}}{{c3-2=20 feet}}{{c4-2=10 feet}}{{c5-2=5 feet}}{{c6-2=2 feet}}{{c7-2=1 foot}}{{c1-3=**Effective**\n**Strength**}}{{c2-3=22 (Garg.)}}{{c3-3=20 (Huge)}}{{c4-3=18 (Large)}}{{c5-3=14 (Medium)}}{{c6-3=10 (Small)}}{{c7-3=4 (Tiny)}}{{c1-4=**Missile Attack**\n**Penalty**}}{{c2-4=–40}}{{c3-4=–20}}{{c4-4=–10}}{{c5-4=–5}}{{c6-4=–2}}{{c7-4=–1}}{{effects2=&emsp;The movement rate represents how fast objects are drawn to or repelled from the center of magnetism. If the creature or object in question is heavier than the magnetized item, the magnetized item does the moving instead. The effective Strength is the “pull” of the magnetism at that range; the size equivalent refers to creature sizes, not weapon sizes. (All human-sized weapons are considered small or tiny for this chart). A character or creature carrying loose metal items or objects such as weapons, shields, helms, buttons, and so on must win an opposed Strength check (see *Player’s Option: Combat & Tactics* for information on opposed ability checks) in order to keep his possessions from being wrenched out of his grasp by the magnetism. Securing a weapon in its sheath, holding an item with both hands, and other precautions may give the character a +2 to +4 to his base ability score, at the DM’s discretion.\n&emsp;Characters wearing metal armor must attempt an opposed Strength check to ignore the effects of the magnetism. If the character fails his Strength check outright, he loses his footing and flies towards or away from the object at the full rate indicated. He suffers full falling damage based on the speed with which he hits the item—1d6 for every 10 feet of the movement rate, or half that damage if he is repelled and simply thrown back onto the ground. If the character passes his Strength check but is beaten by the magnetism roll, he is moved one foot for each point he lost by. Again, some precautions or assistance may help iron-wearing characters in their Strength checks. For monsters, compare the creature’s size to the effective size of magnetism.\n&emsp;An armored character who is stuck to a surface or object loses any Dexterity adjustments to AC and cannot make any physical attacks. He can try to wriggle out of his armor and free himself, employ a magical item, or use psionic powers if he has any at his disposal.\n\n&emsp;*Lodestone the fighter is charging a wizard when the dastardly felon magnetizes a sizable boulder about 30 feet from Lodestone’s present position. Lodestone carries a long sword, a shield, and wears plate mail; he has a Strength of 17. First, he checks to see if he holds onto his sword and shield, making two opposed Strength rolls. He loses the shield, but keeps hold of his sword. Now the DM checks to see if Lodestone resists the drag on his armor. At 30 feet, the magnetism has a Strength of 18. Lodestone rolls a 6, but the magnetism roll is a 12. Even though both Lodestone and the magnetism made their Strength rolls, the magnetism roll is higher than Lodestone’s roll and does not go over its target Strength score. As a result, Lodestone is dragged 6 feet closer to it. Next round, Lodestone tries again and blows his roll altogether, moving a full 10 feet closer. Now only 14 feet from the boulder, the magnetism’s Strength is effectively a 20, which means Lodestone is in big trouble. If he blows his roll again the next round, he’ll go flying into the boulder at a rate of 20 feet/round, which will inflict 2d6 points of damage.*\n\n&emsp;If a creature wins its Strength check, it can ignore the spell’s effects and move out of the zone of influence normally.\n&emsp;*Sirellyn’s superior magnetism* also affects the passage of iron or steel missiles, such as steel-headed arrows or quarrels. Any missile that passes through the zone of influence suffers an attack penalty equal to the movement at the range indicated. For example, if the path of an arrow brings it within 40 feet of a magnetized object, the attack suffers a –5 penalty. Finally, it is possible for the casting wizard to be affected by this spell as well. As a result, the wizard had better make sure that he’s out of the effective area of effect when casting.'

There are two general uses for *persistence*: to use a personal spell effect as needed up to the maximum duration of the *persistence* itself, or to prepare an instantaneous spell and hold it ready until the caster wishes to use it.\n&emsp;**A. Personal effect.** Any spell that augments the wizard’s natural abilities—*detect magic*, *protection from evil*, *jump*, *infravision*, *fly*, *wraithform*, or other caster-affecting spells—can be made persistent by use of this spell. The wizard casts *persistence* and then immediately follows with the desired spell. Instead of taking effect immediately, the magic of the *persistence* holds it ready for use by a simple act of will. The wizard can then “turn on” or “turn off” the girded spell as often as he likes over the course of the duration of the *persistence*. The duration of the girded spell only runs while the spell is active, so a 15th-level wizard who makes a *fly* spell persistent will be able to use 1d6+15 turns of flight (the normal duration of *fly*) over the next 15 days (the duration of the *persistence*) as he sees fit.\n&emsp;This is especially useful because it allows the wizard to cast the girded spell and the *persistence* and have the girded spell’s effects available while he then memorizes another spell in place of the spell made persistent. It is also useful because the girded spell can be activated instantly by an act of will. The main difference between this spell and *contingency* lies in the fact that a persistent spell may be invoked several times (up to the limit of its normal duration) while a *contingency* functions once only.\n&emsp;**B. Held spell.** Spells that have an instantaneous effect, such as most attack spells and some movement spells like *teleport* or *dimension door*, can be rendered persistent as well. The held spell may be activated or discharged at any time during the duration of the *persistence*, but its magic is then exhausted as if it had been cast normally. This resembles the effect of a *contingency* spell, but the effect has no predefined conditions and simply occurs when the caster wills it to.\n&emsp;Damaging or offensive spells that have a duration (for example, *flaming sphere* or *wall of fire*) cannot be rendered persistent. A wizard may have no more than one *persistence* spell active at any given time; if he girds a new spell while an old one is still persistent, the old spell is simply replaced by the new one.'

The wizard can also employ the eye of the sword to create five magical blades that strike as *magic missiles* for 1d4+1 points of damage each.

The wizard may instead choose to expend the eye’s power by casting *enervation* (see the 4th-level wizard spell) upon one target within 30 feet.}}{{c6-2=**Eye of Artifice.** This eye deflects and is destroyed by the first attack directed at the caster from a magical device. If the attack also takes a form that may be blocked by another eye (for example, the bolt from a *wand of lightning*) the caster may choose which eye is expended. If used to attack instead, the eye of artifice functions as a *dispel magic* cast at 8th level.}}{{c7-2=**Eye of Stone.** This eye offers protection against the first attack that could petrify the caster and then vanishes.

The caster can also ignore most magical effects such as spells, magical devices, and innate spell abilities of less than 8th level.\n&emsp;In game terms, the character suffers only 1 point of damage from any type S or type P attack, plus any magical adjustment for the weapon. For example, if struck by a *long sword +1*, he would suffer only 2 points of damage. Strength and specialization bonuses are ignored. If the wizard is dismembered, he suffers no additional damage other than the inconvenience of having his limbs removed, and he can reattach a severed limb by holding it in place for one full turn. The *heart of stone* is also partially effective against type B attacks since it prevents bruising, swelling, and crushed blood vessels. Against bludgeoning weapons, the wizard only suffers half the normal damage. *Cause wound* spells always inflict minimum damage against a wizard protected by this spell. While the caster may not feel a sword in his rib cage, any damage sustained interrupts spellcasting.\n&emsp;In addition to resisting injury, the *heart of stone* also renders the character immune to fatigue and exhaustion, whether normal or magical. He also gains a +4 bonus to saving throws vs. petrification attacks.\n&emsp;While the *heart of stone* is quite powerful, it has limitations. First of all, determined physical attack can eventually destroy the wizard despite his unnatural resistance to injury—a mob of angry peasants with hatchets and spears can finish him off 1 point at a time if that’s what it takes. Second, the *heart* confers no protection against other attack forms, such as fire, electricity, cold, acid, and so on, although any bleeding caused by a burn is ignored. *Disintegration* effects also affect the caster. Most importantly, the caster loses the ability to naturally recover from injury and no longer regains lost hit points with the passage of time. Healing spells, potions and items are reduced to their minimum effect, so a *cure serious wounds* (2d8+1 hit points restored) would only return 3 hit points to a wizard protected by *heart of stone*. However, *limited wish* or *wish* can be used to restore 1 hit point per level of caster or all but 1d4 hit points, respectively.\n&emsp;In addition to these disadvantages, *heart of stone* also renders the caster vulnerable in one other way: his own real heart can be destroyed, instantly slaying him. Naturally, the caster will want to take steps to hide and protect his true heart to prevent this from happening. The living heart continues to beat for the duration of the spell but requires no special receptacle or facilities to protect it—the caster could leave it lying on the floor, if he wished.\n&emsp;The *heart of stone* cannot be dispelled, although a more powerful negation magic such as *Mordenkainen’s disjunction* can bring the spell to an end. *Stone to flesh* also undoes the magic of the *heart of stone*. No matter how the spell is ended, the wizard’s own living heart instantly returns to its proper place, and the stone heart appears wherever the living heart was kept. At this time, any injuries the wizard currently has are multiplied by 1d6 as the wounds begin to bleed again. For example, a necromancer who was injured for 6 points of damage instead suffers 6d6 when the spell ends.'

For example, rust monsters are extremely dangerous to a wizard using this spell. *Heat metal* spells inflict double damage to the caster. And, naturally, the wizard sinks like a stone in water—although he could survive the crushing pressure and lack of air at the bottom of the ocean—at least until the spell expired. Some magical items, such as potions or winded instruments, may be temporarily unusable as well.'

    'effect': 'This particular spell was the last and most powerful spell developed by the archmentalist Rheizom. It allows the wizard to selectively destroy, alter, or implant memories in the subject creature as he sees fit. He can completely reprogram a character, inventing a new persona, a new alignment, and assigning a new class as he sees fit. Only sentient beings can be affected; if the subject is not human, humanoid, or demihuman, he gains a +4 bonus on his saving throw.\n&emsp;As described above, *programmed amnesia* can be used to achieve several different effects. The wizard may choose to make use of any or all of the effects listed below:}}{{style=min1}}{{c1-1=**•**}}{{c2-1=**•**}}{{c3-1=**•**}}{{c4-1=**•**}}{{c5-1=**•**}}{{c6-1=**•**}}{{c1-2=**A. Memory erasure.** Any or all memories possessed by the subject can be erased at the caster’s will, including knowledge of specific events, people, or places.}}{{c2-2=**B. Memory implant.** The caster can create false memories in the subject’s mind as he sees fit. Imaginary friends, events that didn’t really take place, betrayals by people the subject regards as his friends, or the friendship of an enemy could all be implanted in the subject’s mind.}}{{c3-2=**C. Skill erasure.** The subject can be made to forget any or all class-based skills or proficiencies, including all or part of his THAC0 (it resets to 20), thief abilities, spellcasting, turning undead, or any other ability that stems from knowledge. About the only characteristics that can’t be affected by this usage of Rheizom’s *programmed amnesia* are hit points, saving throws, and ability scores. A character’s native language cannot be erased, either.}}{{c4-2=**D. Persona erasure.** Combining the effects of a skill erasure and a memory erasure, this leaves the subject as a clean slate. Only his ability scores, hit points, saving throws, and native language remain. The character may assume any class or alignment available, beginning as a 1st-level character just as if he had decided to dual-class. (Even demihumans can dual-class in this fashion, since they forget all skills of their previous class.)}}{{c5-2=**E. Persona implant.** By erasing the existing personality and implanting a false set of memories, the wizard can build a new persona for the mind-wiped character. In effect, *he* can decide what class, alignment, and personality the subject will assume after his persona erasure. If the new persona is an adventurer, the character dual-classes, as described above.}}{{c6-2=**F. Programmed erasure.** The subject can be programmed to suffer a memory, skill, or persona erasure when a certain event takes place. For example, the wizard could set the subject to be wiped clean as a slate when the subject receives a coded message or arrives at some destination. Optionally, the wizard can decide to have an erasure partially or totally lifted when the programmed condition comes to pass.}}{{effects2=&emsp;The casting time of this spell varies according to what effects the wizard wishes to impose on the subject. To cast just one of the listed effects, the wizard must spend two days secluded away from any distractions—a personal laboratory is a good example of a secluded place. In between the intense eight-hour casting sessions, the wizard can sleep and eat in the area he chose to seclude himself in. If the wizard breaks his seclusion for any reason, the spell is lost. Also, for every effect over the first, another day (with its eight-hour intense casting period) must be spent in seclusion.\n&emsp;The wizard must be able to see the spell’s subject. At the end of each day of casting, the subject makes a saving throw vs. spell to negate the effect.\n&emsp;*Programmed amnesia* is normally permanent, unless the wizard cares to specify a set of conditions or parameters that will end the effect (see F, above). Its effects can only be undone by a *restoration* or *wish* spell, or by successful use of the psionic science psychic surgery. A character who picks up new skills or class abilities while amnesiac must make a saving throw vs. spell when his own real memories return; if he fails, the skills he learned as an amnesiac are gone forever, replaced by his former abilities, but if he succeeds he retains any new skills, and may even choose to continue in his new class as a dual-classed character. Dungeon Masters should keep in mind that an amnesiac character should still meet the new class’s full prerequisites before he can become that class.\n&emsp;Obviously, this is a very powerful spell, and the DM should very carefully examine a PC’s use of this magic. Dungeon Masters, take note—there are dozens of excellent plot vehicles hiding here if an NPC wizard uses this on a player character! Also, be aware that destroying a creature’s personality and replacing it with one more amenable to the wizard’s designs is never a good act.'

    'effect': 'This awful spell brings into existence a short-lived *sphere of annihilation* (as described in Appendix 3 of the *DMG*). The *sphere* is a black ball of nothingness about 2 feet in diameter that instantly and utterly destroys any matter that comes into contact with it. The *sphere* appears anywhere in the spell’s range and moves up to 15 feet per round as the wizard directs. If the wizard attempts to bring the *sphere* into contact with a living creature, the potential victim gains a saving throw vs. breath weapon to dodge aside, but a victim who is unaware of the *sphere’s* appearance or unable to move is destroyed without a saving throw.\n&emsp;Once conjured, the *sphere of ultimate destruction* may not move exactly as the caster wishes. The wizard has a 75% chance to control it, plus 1% per point of Intelligence over 12 and 3% for each point over 15. In other words, a wizard with an Intelligence of 18 would gain a +12% bonus to his chance to control the *sphere*. If the wizard fails to control the *sphere* in any given round, it automatically moves directly towards him at its maximum speed of 15 feet per round. Unlike the magical item, another wizard may not contest the caster’s control of a *sphere of ultimate destruction* unless the second wizard possesses a *talisman of the sphere*. (See the *DMG* .)\n&emsp;Should a *gate* spell be cast upon the *sphere*, there is a 50% chance that the *sphere* is destroyed, a 35% chance that nothing happens, and a 15% chance that a gap is torn in the spatial fabric, catapulting everything in a 180-foot radius to another plane of existence. If the *sphere* is touched by a *rod of cancellation*, a tremendous explosion inflicts 3d4 x 10 points of damage to everything within 60 feet as the two forces negate each other. No other spell or magical item has any effect on a *sphere of ultimate destruction*.\n&emsp;There is a 5% chance that any particular manifestation of this spell does not cause a victim’s utter destruction but instead transports him to a random plane of existence. The conjuring wizard has no way of knowing whether he has destroyed his enemy or merely blasted him into some remote dimension.'
