### Future ideas!
New weapon section that combines hit and damage
- Option to use the 2eattack roll template
- Option to define crits between multiplier or double dice (dice being the most by the book)
- Implement dual wield attacks
- Implement backstab
- Implement special maneuvers as written in the Fighters handbook

Tome of Magic                               1991 May
Add 8th, 9th, and 10th level Priest spells (Psionic enchantments) from Dark Sun Dragon Kings

Add True Dweomers from DMGR: High-Level Campaign

Section for Wand/Staff/Rods:
- Capture initiative modifiers
- Maybe autofill? Could give players information they should not have.

Section for Misc magical items
- Capture initiative modifier
- Easy place to hold all items

Update Potions to have "chugs" instead of quantity
- Each potion should have its own line in the section.
- Add Potion Compatibility table from DMG p. 191

Update Scrolls to write "Fireball scroll" instead of "Scroll of Fireball"
- Or just add the "scroll of" added to the Macro and not the name.
- Group spells on the same scroll paper somehow. Maybe a notes field, explaining what paper it is on?

Scrolls / Potions
The knowledge of how to create scrolls and potions of similar function to a known spell does not just leap into his brain. He knows where to look for the information he needs to make an attempt (sages, higher level spellcaster, higher powers). The exact process for each spell is still a mystery. DMG p. 118-119

Scrolls
Wizard
- Create scrolls 9th level. PHB p. 43, DMG p. 117
- Wizards must have their spellbook at hand. DMG p. 119
Priest
- Create scrolls at 7th level. DMG p. 117
- Priests must work on a specially prepared alter. DMG p. 119

Quill and Ink must be of special or magical origin and be fresh and unused for each spell (even each inscription of the same spell requires new Quill and Ink). DMG p. 119
Success rate is known by the DM. DMG p. 119
Protection scrolls takes 6 days of undisturbed work. DMG p. 119

- Priests Brew a few potions (mainly healing and cures) at 9th level. DMG p. 117, 119
- In addition to the fantastical materials needed, potions require mundane ingredients. The basic cost of these ingredients ranges from 200 to 1,000 gp. DMG p. 119
- Wizards needs a complete alchemical laboratory. The basic cost is at least 2,000 gp for the equipment and furnishings. The location and housing is added on top of this cost. The wizard must pay 10% of its value every month for maintenance. DMG p. 120
- Priests need an alter specially consecrated to the purpose of brewing potions. DMG p. 120
- To create a potion is equal to cost of materials in gp / 100. DMG p. 120

Other Magical items
- Wizards create other magical items at 11th level, (if he has the spells). DMG p. 117

- Preparing the materials takes from 2 weeks to a month and costs at least 500 gold pieces, if not more. DMG p. 121
Wizards
- First cast _Enchant an Item_ (or have another do it for them) then perform whatever is needed. DMG p. 121
- If no _permanency_ spell is cast in the end, the vessel only holds charges equal to the number of spells cast upon it. DMG p. 121
- Success is known by the DM. DMG p. 121
Priests. DMG p. 121
- Must first find the vessel of the finest or most perfect materials
- The priest must then spend two weeks in meditation and purification ceremonies and then another week in fasting and purification, to purify himself
- Then he must likewise purify the item and seek to invoke it a small portion of his deity's grandeur. This takes a single day and night.
- As the item rests upon an alter, the priest must pray for the blessed sign that the deity will endow the vessel with the desired powers. Each day there is a 1% cumulative chance that the prayers will be heard.
- Once complete the item needs to be sanctified and consecrated for a permanent enchant
- For charges, the priest have 24 hours to cast the appropriate spells into the item

Druids
