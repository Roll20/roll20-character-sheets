<strong>Scroll specific spellcasting information</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Scrolls have a read time equal to the inscribed spell's cast time (PHB p. 125 / DMG p. 196)</li>
    <li>Scrolls are used up and lost if they are disrupted during casting (Sage Advice #157 p. 25)</li>
    <li>Scrolls always has a casting level (for determining level-based variables such as range, damage, duration, and resistance to dispel attempts) of one level higher than the minimum required to cast it, but never less than 6th level. In other words, the act of writing a scroll limits its power (DMG p. 196 + Sage Advice #248 p. 20+22)</li>
    <li>Scrolls are cast at the level at which they were inscribed (DMG p. 196)</li>
    <li>Scrolls require no material components to cast (PHB p. 144 / DMG p. 118)</li>
    <li>No adverse effects associated with casting the spell are suffered by the reader. These requirements or penalties have already been fulfilled or suffered by the creator of the scroll (DMG p. 196)</li>
