<strong>Wizards and Priests</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Casting scrolls containing spells of a level too high for the character to cast incurs a 5% failure rate per level between the character's present level and the level at which the spell could be cast (DMG p. 196)
        <ul>
            <li>If the DM allow characters to control the casting level of scrolls they scribe, the failure chance should be 5% between the character's present level and the scrolls casting level. (Sage Advice #248 p. 20+22)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Scroll spell failure is either Total Failure (nothing happens) or Reverse / Harmful Failure effect (DMG p. 196)</li>
</ul>
<strong>Rogues</strong>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Thieves</strong> casting scrolls have 25% failure chance. Failure is always a reverse of the effect (PHB p. 58)</li>
    <li><strong>Bards</strong> casting scrolls have 15% failure chance. Failure is always a reverse of the effect (PHB p. 61)</li>
</ul>
<strong>Dual/Multi-class Spellcaster/Rogue</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Uses the best failure chance of the two classes. (Sage Advice #260 p. 23)
        <ul>
            <li>The DM can allow the player to choose what class is trying to use the scroll. (Sage Advice #260 p. 23)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Failure follows the rules of the class the chance belongs to. Rogues always have a harmful effect while spellcasters can have a Total Failure with no catastrophic effects. (Sage Advice #260 p. 23)</li>
</ul>
