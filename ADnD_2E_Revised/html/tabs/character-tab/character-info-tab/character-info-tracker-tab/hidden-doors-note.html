    <summary>Notes for finding Concealed/Secret doors</summary>
    <strong>Concealed doors</strong>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>All characters</strong> automatically find a <em>concealed door</em> when actively searching for it. (DMG p. 176)</li>
        <li><strong>Elves</strong> and <strong>Half-elves</strong> have a 3 in 6 chance of finding a <em>concealed door</em> when merely passing with in 10 feet of it.
            <ul>
                <li>This is a departure from the PHB p. 29-31. Since the DMG states that all character automatically finds a <em>concealed door</em> when actively searching, the Elf and Half-elf 3 in 6 of actively finding a <em>concealed door</em> has been moved from the active search to passive.
