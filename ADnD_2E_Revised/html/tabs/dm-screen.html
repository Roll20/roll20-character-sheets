    <textarea name="attr_charm" class="sheet-hidden">
&{template:2Edefault} {{name=Charm}} {{align=justify}} {{align1=center}} {{desc=The effect of charms are loosely defined and often contradictory. The DM has final say in the effects of charm. The following is a guideline. From here on out the person or creature charmed will be referred to as the *victim* and the charmer as the *master*.

**Effect of charm:** The *victim* sees the *master* as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The *victim* is not controlled as if it were an automaton, but any word or action of the *master* is viewed in the most favorable way, therefore the *victim* believes that the *master* would never harm it or tell it a lie. To be clear, the *victim* does not necessarily believe everything the caster says, but it is always certain the caster is not really trying to lie. Thus, the *victim* might believe the *master* if assured that the only chance to save the *master’s* life is for the *victim* to hold back an onrushing red dragon for "just a minute or two" and if the *victim’s* view of the situation suggests that this course of action still allows a reasonable chance of survival.
&emsp;The *victim’s* attitudes and priorities are changed with respect to the *master*. However, the *victim* basic personality and alignment are unchanged. Therefore, the *victim* does not necessarily reveal everything it knows or draw maps of entire areas. Any request may be refused, if such refusal is in character and does not directly harm the *master*.

**Combat:** The *victim* no longer has control over its decisions, it loses all sense of personal initiative and does nothing unless commanded by the *master*, except for defending itself.
&emsp;If the *victim* is compelled to fight his companions it must do so in an effect manner. Grappling or punching is not acceptable if the *victim* possesses a better method. The *victim* need use only those abilities that are obvious to his new *master*. Therefore, a *master* commanding: "Fight with your most powerful magical item!" would not be obeyed as it requires individual initiative from the *victim* determining which item that is.
&emsp;Thus, if a charmed fighter with a sword at his side is carrying a *javelin of lightning*, he fights with his sword unless specifically commanded to do otherwise. The *master* in this case could not command him to use the *javelin of lightning* unless he had some way of knowing the fighter carried one.
&emsp;Similarly, a wizard’s *master* must know which spells his charmed spellcaster possesses, and which he has memorized. This is most commonly learned simply by asking. However, due to the *victim’s* befuddled state, there is a 25 percent chance that he will unwittingly cast a spell harmful to himself and his *master*. Relying on charmed spellcasters can be a very risky business.
&emsp;A *master* can keep any number of *victims* under his thumb at once, but there are practical limitations to how many *victims* the *master* can control at once; under most conditions, the *master* might issues brief commands to four or five *victims* in a single round.

**Fighting friends / companions / party members:** It is possible for the *master* to persuade the *victim* to attack former comrades, but the *master’s* intention must be clear and might need to be very insistent if the *victim* is lawful or good and is loyal to its original group. Such communication is seldom possible in the midst of combat, though the *master* can draw the *victim* aside for a chat. Note that if the *victim’s* associates try to prevent the *victim* from leaving the group, it becomes much easier for the *master* to convince the *victim* that the former allies are enemies.

**Degrees of charm:** Monsters with innate charm powers, such as vampires, use mental commands, making verbal communication unnecessary. The range of the mental commands is the same as normal speech (about 30 feet) and requires that no solid barrier is between the *master* and the *victim*. The *victim* obeys the *master* totally, and will gladly allow a vampire *master* to feed on its blood.
&emsp;Characters need verbal communication, preferably by speaking a shared language. Otherwise, hand gestures can be used.

**Two charm effects:** If two or more charm effects simultaneously affect a *victim*, the result is decided by the DM. This could range from one effect being clearly dominant, to the subject being torn by conflicting desires, to new saving throws that could negate both spells.}} {{desc1=Player’s Handbook p. 171+258

    <textarea name="attr_breaking-charm" class="sheet-hidden">
&{template:2Edefault} {{name=Breaking Charm}} {{align=justify}} {{align1=center}} {{desc=Here are some of the various ways a charm can be broken:

All saving throws include Wisdom modifiers.
&emsp;**Initial:** The *victim* gets an initial saving throw, as described in the spell, with a +1 bonus per damage point received from the *master* or his allies in the same round that the charm is cast.
&emsp;**Periodically:** The majority of charm effects give periodic saves based on the *victims* intelligence score.
&emsp;**Harm:** If the *master* harms or attempts to harm the *victim* the charm is broken automatically.
&emsp;**Dispel:** If a successful *dispel magic* or a *dispel evil/good* is used against a charm cast by a evil/good creature respectively, the charm is broken.
&emsp;**Situational:** Some situations might be so against the *victim’s* nature that an immediate saving throw is allowed. Instances could be:
• Request *victim* to become defenseless.
• Request *victim* to give up valued item.
• Request *victim* to to use charge from valued item (especially against former allies).
• Request an action completely contrary to the *victim’s* ethos or alignment. (Ask druid to burn down the forrest, ask paladin to defile a holy place, etc.).
• Too much abuse or interference from *master’s* companions if this is out of character for the *victim*.
• Two charm effects from different *masters* simultaneously affect the *victim*.

**Knowledge of the *victim*:** If the *victim* makes its initial saving throw it is strongly recommend that it knows something is up by feeling a twinge or unpleasant tingle. The DM can opt to allow a Spellcraft check to identify the type of spell.
&emsp;It is recommended that *victims* are clueless to the presence of the charm when they fail their saving throw, while the charm last. Once the charm wears off an intelligent *victim* might conclude that something was amiss depending on what transpired while the charm was in effect.
&emsp;The less ordinary the *victim’s* actions, the more likely the *victim* is to realize someone tampered with his mind. For example, if a PC charms a tightfisted merchant to give him a big discount, the merchant should wonder what made him give the PC such a good deal once the charm wears of.
&emsp;The more ordinary the *victim’s* actions, the less likely the subject is to realize he has been charmed. For example, if a PC ducks into a shop while running from the town guard and uses a charm effect to persuade the merchant not to turn him in, the merchant probably will be none the wiser (particularly if the merchant wasn’t too honest to begin with). If the PC then buys something from the merchant for a generous sum, the merchant might well remember the PC fondly.
&emsp;Any hostility the *victim* might have felt towards the *master* before the charm took effect, remains after the charm wears off (perhaps amplified by the *master’s* actions while the charm was running).
&emsp;If the *master* dies while the charm is running, the charm runs it course. The *victim* will mourn the loss of a "friend", but no further control over the *victim* is possible as only the *master* could exercise it.}} {{desc1=Player’s Handbook p. 171+258

    <textarea name="attr_touch-attacks" class="sheet-hidden">
        &{template:2Edefault} {{name=Touch-delivered Spells and Attacks}} {{align=justify}} {{align1=center}} {{desc=Outside of combat touch-delivered spells are automatic and no attack roll is needed. However, if the spell is used in the midst of a general melee, or the target is unwilling, a successful attack roll is required for the spell to have any effect.
&emsp;**Willing Targets:** The casting is automatic as long as both characters are not engaged in combat. For example, if a fighter withdraws from melee, a cleric could heal him the next round. If the recipient of the spell attempts to do *anything* besides waiting for the spell to take effect, an attack roll against AC 10 must be made. However, no AC modifiers for Dexterity are applied, since the target is not trying to avoid the spell!
&emsp;**Unwilling Targets:** The spellcaster must make a successful attack roll for the spell to have any effect. A multi-classed caster, like a fighter/mage, can use their best available THAC0. The DM can modify the roll if the target is unprepared for or unaware of the attack. ***Optional:*** The DM decides if Strength bonuses or penalties modify touch attempts.
&emsp;The Armor Class to hit depends on the combat system and spell used:
&emsp;**Player’s Handbook combat system:** The spellcaster calculates his to-hit number normally, according to the intended target’s Armor Class and other protections.
&emsp;**PLAYER’S OPTION: Spells & Magic combat system:** Touch-delivered spells generally bypass armor, *ignore the portion of the target’s Armor Class that is derived from wearing armor.* Only Dexterity-based and magical adjustments help a character’s Armor Class. A guard wearing a plate mail +1 would only get a 1-point Armor Class bonus from the armor’s enchantment, which makes him AC 9 to hit, instead of his usual AC 2. For specific spell information see PO: S&M p. 120.

Touch attacks can be used while blind or against invisible targets with -4 to hit. If the attack roll succeeds, the spellcaster touches the target and the normal spell effect occurs.

**Duration:** When a touch spell is cast, it normally remains effective only for the round when it was cast. For example *Cause light wounds* must be used in the same round in which it was cast. The spellcaster has to “use it or lose it”.
&emsp;Some spells like *Dispel Evil* or *Shocking Grasp* remain active for a short time or until triggered. A few spells like *Chill Touch* remain active for the full duration, allowing multiple successful touch attacks from a single casting of the spell. Be sure to check each spell description carefully.
&emsp;The speed factor of a touch attack is included in the casting time of the spell. Later touch attempts can optionally be given the “natural” attack speed factor depending on the attacker’s size. For a small/man-sized creature, the speed factor is 3.

**Target’s special defense: ** Whenever a touch spell is successful, the spellcaster suffers from any special defenses of his target, if they are continually in operation. A successful touch to a fire elemental would result in serious burns, but touching a vampire would not result in energy drain, since the power only works when the vampire wills it.
&emsp;The spellcaster is considered “armed” with the spell and does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Likewise the target is not allowed to use the “Weapons in Defense” rule and does not get a +4 bonus to attack and damage rolls.

        <ul>
            <li>Magical items are more resistant to damage, gaining bonuses to the saving throw. Items with a plus (a <em>sword +1</em>, for example) gain that plus as a bonus to the die roll. If the item possesses additional special abilities, it should have an extra plus for each of these.</li>
            <li>Magical items with no stated pluses should gain a bonus relative to their power. A potion would have a +1 while a miscellaneous magical item could have a +5 or +6.</li>
            <li>Further, if the saving throw is versus an attack the device was designed to counter (e.g., extreme cold vs. a <em>ring of warmth</em>), an additional bonus of +2 is allowed.</li>
        </ul>
        Corrections for the Revised (Black) Dungeon Master Guide. WoTC official website.
        <ul>
            <li>Potions should save against Normal Fire at 14 (not 4 as listed)</li>
            <li>Rope should save against Lightning at 9 (not 12 as listed)</li>
            <li>Wood, thick should save against Lightning at 12 (not 9 as listed)</li>
        </ul>
        The Original (Blue) Dungeon Master Guide 3rd printing is correct.
