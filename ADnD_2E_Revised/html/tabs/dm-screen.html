        <ul>
            <li>Magical items are more resistant to damage, gaining bonuses to the saving throw. Items with a plus (a <em>sword +1</em>, for example) gain that plus as a bonus to the die roll. If the item possesses additional special abilities, it should have an extra plus for each of these.</li>
            <li>Magical items with no stated pluses should gain a bonus relative to their power. A potion would have a +1 while a miscellaneous magical item could have a +5 or +6.</li>
            <li>Further, if the saving throw is versus an attack the device was designed to counter (e.g., extreme cold vs. a <em>ring of warmth</em>), an additional bonus of +2 is allowed.</li>
        </ul>
        Corrections for the Revised (Black) Dungeon Master Guide. WoTC official website.
        <ul>
            <li>Potions should save against Normal Fire at 14 (not 4 as listed)</li>
            <li>Rope should save against Lightning at 9 (not 12 as listed)</li>
            <li>Wood, thick should save against Lightning at 12 (not 9 as listed)</li>
        </ul>
        The Original (Blue) Dungeon Master Guide 3rd printing is correct.
