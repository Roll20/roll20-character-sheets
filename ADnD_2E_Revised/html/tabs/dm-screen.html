&emsp;A revealing action (which could range from an attack to tripping over a pile of pots) immediately negates the need for a saving throw. In such cases, the invisible character is immediately ***noticed***.
&emsp;Once a invisible creatures is ***noticed***, its general location is known and a -4 attack roll can be made or an area of effect spell can be cast against them, with a +4 to the invisible creatures saving throw.

**Pinpointing an invisible creature:** Requires the detecting creature to actually see the invisible creature. This can be achieved by *detect invisibility*, *true seeing* or by covering the invisible creature in flour or another substance.

            <li>Magical items are more resistant to damage, gaining bonuses to the saving throw. Items with a plus (a <em>sword +1</em>, for example) gain that plus as a bonus to the die roll. If the item possesses additional special abilities, it should have an extra plus for each of these.</li>
            <li>Magical items with no stated pluses should gain a bonus relative to their power. A potion would have a +1 while a miscellaneous magical item could have a +5 or +6.</li>
            <li>Further, if the saving throw is versus an attack the device was designed to counter (e.g., extreme cold vs. a <em>ring of warmth</em>), an additional bonus of +2 is allowed.</li>
