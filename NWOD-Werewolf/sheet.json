  "instructions": "#Character Sheet\rWhole Sheet: Inlcudes several repeating sections spread throughout the sheet.  Any an all input will be appreciated, especially in regards to improvements.\r*First Tab: The busiest tab. The radio buttons, checkboxes, tabs, arrow buttons...basically everything awesome on the sheet, was originally designed by Brian, and displayed here: https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/882997/css-wizardry#post-1460538.  Check it, there is much awesome.  The radio buttons fill from the left with extra box on hover to delete contents of circles, the health boxes rotate from non-existent boxes, to undamaged, to bashing, to lethal, to aggravated, back to non-existent. Common Dice pools are now availible.  Simply plug in the number of dice to be rolled, give is a name- such as shooting-a-gun or combing-fur and hit the button.  It will autocalc the number of dice that roll higher than 7.  Please note, 8-, 9-, and 10-again rule is not part of this, so mouse over the result in the chatbox to see it you need a re-roll. \r*Second Tab: Mostly expanded sections for more elaborate details. \r*Third Tab: Special note to the tiny triangle off to the side of the expanded merits section: clicking it will reveal the a lot of text areas.  \r*Fourth Tab: History, description, and general character information.",
