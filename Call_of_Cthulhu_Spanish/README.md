Multilingual investigator Sheet for Call of Cthulhu 5th edition. I hope you'll find it useful. I have aimed for a look and feel like the original sheet as well as included most of the rolls that will be needed. For good measure I've included an automated resistance roll calculator on the sheet as I thought that might come in handy. All of the styling is in the html so the code is probably unnecessarily messy, but I just couldn't figure out how to work the CSS. Cleaning up the code would be a project for the future. As it stands now the sheet seems to be working as it should.
