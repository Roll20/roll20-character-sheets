  "instructions": "# Werewolf: The Apocalyspe Character Sheet\r For use in the classic World of Darkness, 2nd edition revised.  Designed to function much like an actual paper sheet would.  With the most notable exception being that you can roll Rage, Gnosis and Willpower directy from the sheet.  Also, The Dice Pool section in the center at the bottom allow one to select an Attribute and/or Ability to roll; The Other Traits may also be seleceted in the Ability drop down.  The check to the left of each die pool selection indicates that the roll has a specialty (i.e. dice will explode)  All rolls from the sheet are of the from {Xd10}>Df1 or {Xd10!}>Df1 if special, where X is the number of dice and D is the difficulty.  NOTE: These roll do not recognize botches. Further, the rolls will prompt the user to modify the number of dice rolled and set the difficulty.  The defaults for these are 0 and 6 respectively.  The Forms area at the bottom is intended to help keep track of your current form and remind you of the statistical changes, these buttons do not change any rolls.",
