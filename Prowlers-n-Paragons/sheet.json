This icon is to indicate which Super Traits are \"Strong,\" requiring additional points to advance.\r\r###Roll Buttons\rRoll buttons have been added for all traits. Because PP uses a d6 mechanic with odds being failure and evens success, for ease of play, the roll buttons calculate success based on the roll being 4+. It was my understanding that the Odd/Even thing has not other special meaning, other than to determine success/failure. So, given this paradigm, 4+ has the same odds of success as the odd/even thing.\r\r"
