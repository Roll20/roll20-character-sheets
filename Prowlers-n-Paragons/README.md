Prowlers and Paragons Character Sheet
======================================

This character sheet is designed for ease of navigationâ€”everything is on one sheet, with a similar layout to the standard Prowlers and Paragons character sheet.

Traits: All Mundane Traits are on the sheet and default to 2d. Super Traits can be added as needed.

Super Traits: Each Super Trait has an icon next to it that can be toggled on/off. This icon is to indicate which Super Traits are "Strong," requiring additional points to advance.

Roll Buttons: Roll buttons have been added for all traits. Because PP uses a d6 mechanic with odds being failure and evens success, for ease of play, the roll buttons calculate success based on the roll being 4+. It was my understanding that the Odd/Even thing has not other special meaning, other than to determine success/failure. So, given this paradigm, 4+ has the same odds of success as the odd/even thing.
