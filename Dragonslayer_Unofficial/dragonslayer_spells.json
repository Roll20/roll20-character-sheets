The targeted wizard is allowed a saving throw (Spell) to negate. The target receives a save modification based on Level Differential. Level Differential is either a bonus or penalty applied for every level of difference between the caster and the targeted wizard. For example, if the caster of Absent Lapse is Level 2 and the target is Level 4, the target would receive a bonus of +2 on the save, or if the caster was Level 5 and the target Level 2, the target would have a -3 penalty, etc. The Absent Lapse cannot penetrate magic resistance, a Globe of Invulnerability , or magic items that reflect spells."

The constructs remain animated until destroyed or until their necromantic enchantment is dismissed via Dispel Magic. The caster's level determines the total hit dice of the undead raised (Skeletons HD: 1 or Zombies HD: 2). A Level 6 Cleric, for example, can animate six skeletons or three zombies. Alternatively s/he could animate four skeletons and one zombie. The undead possess no intelligence, abilities, or memories from life. See the respective entries for skeletons and zombies in the monster section. Note that the dead are not easily roused and must be commanded to do so convincingly and authoritatively.

The caster may only animate objects of mundane material. A being's carried or equipped objects cannot be animated. The Maze Controller must exercise judgment with this spell in relation of the following parameters. The shape of an animated object determines its movement ability. For example, a rope slithers, a chest shuffles, a chair gallops, a vial rolls, etc. Movement ranges from slow (10ft/rd) to fast (60ft/rd). For example, a candelabra might bend and drag itself 10 feet per round, whereas a chair might gallop at the fastest movement rate. To attack, objects use the caster's Attack Bonus. The Maze Controller's determines whether an object receives one attack or one every two rounds. Both hit points and damage depend on the object size and shape, with 1d6 considered the baseline. Reasonable adjustments up or down are at the discretion of the Maze Controller."

The animated dead are plant-based. They are not considered undead and cannot be turned by clerics. They will obey the caster until destroyed, the caster is slain, or they are dismissed by Dispel Magic. The spell animates 1 hit die for every level of the caster. For example, a Level 5 Cleric could raise five skeletons (HD: 1 each) or two zombies (HD: 2 each) and one skeleton (HD: 1), etc. The skeletons and zombies animated have the same hit dice, armor class, and movement rates as their undead counterparts.

The caster (and companion travellers) can only take items that exist on the Astral Plane. The Astral Plane connects to other planes and the caster may also travel to these locations. The caster creates a new physical manifestation on the desired plane. The caster anchors himself to his physical body on the Prime Material Plane through an enchanted silver cord. At any point, if the cord is severed, either on the Astral or the Material Plane, the caster dies. The silvery cord is attached invisibly to the caster for the duration of the spell. If the astral form's second manifestation is killed, the cord pulls the caster's soul back to his suspended body on the Material Plane.

Once cast, the clone must be gestated in a wizard's workshop, for a period of 1d4+2 months. Once the clone gestates to maturity, a psychic link forms between the two beings for one week. If the original is still alive during this time period, both entities will actively attempt to kill each other. If neither succeeds, there is a 95% likelihood that one of them, either the clone (75% chance) or the original (25% chance), turns insane. There is a chance (5%) that both turn insane. After one week, if neither manages to eliminate the other, the mental link dissipates, and the compulsion to slay each other ceases. The spell only replicates the original being's mind and body, not their equipment."

The caster may, at any time, return to the jar (and return the trapped soul) and possess a different body. Magic Jar concludes when the caster returns to his/her own body. To cast the spell, the caster must ensure the Magic Jar in within range. Possessing a body requires a round and the target receives a saving throw (Spell) to negate the spell.

Upon a successful possession, the caster retains his or her level, alignment, class, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, but adopts the target’s Consitution, Strength, Dexterity, hit points, and physical abilities. The caster does not adopt the host’s spells or spell-like abilities. A Dispel Evil or Exorcism forces the caster out of the host’s body.

Magic Mouth cannot throw spells. Regardless of where the wizard places Magic Mouth, the lips exactly mimic the words uttered. If cast on a statue, for example, the statue’s mouth would appear to speak. The caster can place Magic Mouth on inanimate objects only. The mouth triggers when specific conditions are met at the time of casting. Triggers can be general, or specific, but must be tactile, visual, or audible. Audible triggers could include general noise or a specific keyword. Visible or audible actions can also be encoded. A Magic Mouth cannot discern between level, alignment, class, or hit dice, unless keyed to garments. The trigger range is five feet per caster level.
