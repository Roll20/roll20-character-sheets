Preliminary Observation: The initial stage of assessment requires external examination of the item.

Practical Examination: The second stage of assessment requires the magic-user equip the item in question. Therefore, a potion must be sipped, boots must be worn, or a weapon held in-hand, etc. The caster possesses a 15% chance (+5% per level) each round of discerning one power of an item. This includes curses not detected in Preliminary Observation. The wizard receives an additional 5% for each point of Intelligence bonus. The spell can divine specific powers and abilities, but this excludes weapon or armor bonuses. These must be determined exclusively in combat.

A Magic Mouth can speak any message, in a language known by the caster to a maximum of 25 words. The caster can designate the number of times the message repeats (to a maximum of 10 rounds). Magic Mouth cannot throw spells.<br><br>Regardless of where the wizard places Magic Mouth , the lips exactly mimic the words uttered. If cast on a statue, for example, the statue's mouth would appear to speak. The caster can place Magic Mouth on inanimate objects only.<br><br>The mouth triggers when specific conditions are met at the time of casting. Triggers can be general, or specific, but must be tactile, visual, or audible. Audible triggers could include general noise or a specific keyword. Visible or audible actions can also be encoded. A Magic Mouth cannot discern between level, alignment, class, or hit dice, unless keyed to garments. The trigger range is five feet per caster level. Therefore, a Level 6 wizard can command a Magic Mouth to respond to a trigger as far as 30 feet away. A Magic Mouth can only respond subject to its triggers. For example, a visual trigger requires line of sight. The spell's duration is permanent, until its conditions are met and the spell discharges.}}"></button>

            for the mage. Once the task is complete, the demon is dismissed to its plane of existence. Demon summonings
            are risky business, even for the most experienced of wizards. A magic-user has a 6% probability of

The gem traps a being indefinitely. Before casting Trap the Soul , the mage must purchase a gem of not less than 1,000gp for each hit die possessed by the target. If the gem breaks, the soul is released and allows the physical body to materialize. The spell can be activated in two manners:<br><br>Spell Completion: Upon completing the spell the target is allowed a saving throw (Spell) for no effect. If successful, the gemstone disintegrates into dust.<br><br>Trigger Object: This method tricks the target into taking an item inscribed with his/her name and the final word of the spell. The caster could also place Sympathy on the item or object. When the final word is read, the spell imprisons the being's soul (no save).}}"></button>

The wizard can project and center the sound anywhere within range. The caster could, for example, create footsteps (approaching or retreating), or voices (loud or soft), etc. The caster can produce sound equivalent to four medium-sized humanoids. The wizard may also increase the sound by four humanoids for each level beyond the minimum required to cast the spell. Note the caster may only use the spell to imitate any sound he or she has heard in the past (human, animal, monster, etc.). If the caster desires a variation on the volume as outlined above, the Maze Controller determines the volume generated. For instance, the sound of four humans might approximate eight children or one troll. All those who actively disbelieve, are allowed a saving (Spell) to recognize the illusionary sound.}}"></button>

            between the caster's level and the level of the spell. A bonus of +2 is applied to the Intelligence Check if
