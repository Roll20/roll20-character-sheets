This character sheet is designed for a New World of Darkness:  Mage the Awakening campaign.  The campaign has vampires, geniuses, werewolves, and many more supernatural foes so the sheet is designed to accomodate all these and should be useful for all New World of Darkness campaigns.

Some limitations to keep in mind:

1.  The sheet automatically calculates derived attributes like Health, Willpower, Initiative Modifier, etc. but there are some things that it cannot such as Defense.

2.  Stats for weapons, guns or armor entered on the sheet cannot auto-populate the appropriate fields in the Combat section.  You'll have to do that yourself.  

3.  Formatting gets wonky if the web browser is zoomed in or zoomed out.  

4.  Keep in mind when using the Combat and Cast buttons that fields such as Using Willpower are not reset after each attack/spell.  

Feel free to use, alter, etc as you wish.  Enjoy.
