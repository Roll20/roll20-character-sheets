# Sheet Instructions
This is a character sheet for The Yellow King RPG written by Robin D. Laws and Published by Pelgrane Press.

It includes four separate versions of the sheet, one for each of the game's four sequences.  It is recommended that you adjust the default sheet settings to reflect the sequence you are playing in, as new sheets will automatically be created using the chosen sequence.  Once a character has been created, you can use the dropdown menu it the upper right corner to change to a different sequence.  Character attributes will be preserved across sequence changes, but they will be hidden if the currently selected sequence doesn't include those attribues.

Use Roll20's card deck functions to track shocks and injuries.

Gaze not at the Yellow Sign.
