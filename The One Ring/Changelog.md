## 2.0

*Update by the **Fellowship of the Roll20 Character Sheet**. This is intended to be as close as possible to the formatting of the print version of the 'The One Ring' character sheet, while still fully compatible with version 1.0.0 of the sheet, and with data from the 'Anneau Unique' and 'Der Eine Ring' sheets.*

* use a styled background
* display diamond checkboxes for common skills and skill groups
* format and style experience, valour and wisdom in top right of sheet
* use a serif font
* delay display of help text for skills until one second after hover

### New features
* optimise translations for English, German, French and Spanish (e.g. switch the logo)
* support migrating from 'Der Eine Ring' and 'Anneau Unique' sheets
* Add 'Mounts' for horses etc.
* fixed slots for weapons (for ease of scripting macros)
* specific skills for Loremaster Characters (reflecting how this is done in the printed books)
