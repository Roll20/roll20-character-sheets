This is the official endorsed roll20 character sheet for Skeleton.

**Functionality:**\
All attributes/skills can be assigned a d4-d12 dice value which is then used in all roll buttons to roll dice.
There are sections for extra items, weapons, boons and curses which can be edited. 
The descriptions/resources for extra items, boons and curses can be accessed through the checkboxes which toggle them on/off.
The configuration section only has two options currently, but there are more possible config options which can be added as needed.
