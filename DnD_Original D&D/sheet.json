    This is a Player sheet for Original Dungeons & Dragons by Gary Gygax and Dave Arenson, the 1974 original edition and any combination of suppliments you like.\r
    This sheet will also work well for Holmes Basic Dungeons & Dragons edited by Eric Holmes (sometime called Blue Book D&D).\r
    \r
    ## Player Sheet\r
    \r
    * This sheet is lacking automatic roll buttons as a feature, to allow for maximum flexibility for the DM.\r
    * While it is tempting to add attack rolls, this assume use of the Alternate Combat System rather than Chainmail.\r
    * Similarly, ability checks are not added as there are multiple ways to adjudicate ability checks (3d6 roll under, variable number of d6, roll under a d20, and more).\r
