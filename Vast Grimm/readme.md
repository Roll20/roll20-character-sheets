# _Vast Grimm_ Character Sheet

This character sheet was developed for [_Vast Grimm_](https://vastgrimm.com).

Vast Grimm's official character generator, [PROGENITOR](https://vastgrimm.com/character-generator/), is recommended for quick PC creation.

This character sheet is a fork of the Character Sheet developed for [_Mörk Borg_](http://www.morkborg.com).

To the best of my knowledge/ability, the sheet is set up for internationalization/translation of all text displayed in the sheet and outputted from sheet roll buttons.
