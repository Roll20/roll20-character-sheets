This is an Advanced character sheet for the Dark Heresy 2nd Edition role-playing game. It differs greatly from the standard character sheet available and utilizes API scripts to accurately (and correctly) provide dice rolls measuring Degrees of Success and Degrees of Failure. It has been redesigned to include a multitude of differing features and organizations. 

The changes include tabbed divisions for organization, repeatable fields added to gear items, cybernetics, psychic powers, skills and talents, provided an 'Other skill' field for overflow of Trade/Lore/Specializations of Operate, and built-in macros for variable initiative rolls. 

Note: The following API Scripts must be utilized in your API console for this sheet to work properly;
