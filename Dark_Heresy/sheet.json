([[(@{characteristic}+?{Modifier|0}-1d100)/10]] degree(s) of success!)\rIt takes the characteristic you sleected in the drop down, then you may add or subtract a modifier, then it rolls 1d100 and subtracts that from your starting value. That divided by 10 is the amount of degrees of success you achieved.\r**You can emulate everything in this sheet with just this single roll if you don't want to use the rest!**\r",
