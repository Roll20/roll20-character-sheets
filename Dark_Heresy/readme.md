Most things you can roll directly from the sheet, by clicking on the corresponding name or the roll button at the end of the row.
With weapons: Clicking on 'Name:' rolls an attack, clicking on 'Damage:' rolls the damage you have entered in the field next to it. **Please just enter things like 1d10+2, because it will be transferred to an inline roll - no letters!**

The most important roll is the %{characteristic} roll. ([[(@{characteristic}+?{Modifier|0}-1d100)/10]] degree(s) of success!)
It takes the characteristic you sleected in the drop down, then you may add or subtract a modifier, then it rolls 1d100 and subtracts that from your starting value. That divided by 10 is the amount of degrees of success you achieved.
**You can emulate everything in this sheet with just this single roll if you don't want to use the rest!**
