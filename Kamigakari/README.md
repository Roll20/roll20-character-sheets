# Roll20-Kamigakari



This is a character sheet for Kamigakari: God Hunters. 

Use the check boxes to keep track of spent spirit dice, then hit the spirit pool button to roll those dice.
The track button next 'Initiative' to adds that character to the initiative tracker. You must have the token selected.

The Mononoke tab is for both contractors and Mononoke. For macro use all stats start with mononoke_ but are otherwise as they appear on the ship for example: 

mononoke_acc
mononoke_Initiative 

Thanks to Jakob for the Text Expanding Area CSS and plexsoup for the working tabs
