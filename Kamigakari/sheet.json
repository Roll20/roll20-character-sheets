  "instructions": "This is a character sheet for Kamigakari: God Hunters. \r The checkboxes below the spirit pool dropdown menus are for keeping track of what been used. The Spirit Pool button rolls the spent spirit dice. \r Use the 'Track' button next to 'Initiative' to add that character to the initiative tracker. You must have the token selected. \r The Mononoke tab is for both contractors and Mononoke. For macros, all stats start with mononoke_ but are otherwise as they appear on the ship for example: \r mononoke_acc \r mononoke_Initiative \r The Gear Tab has fields that can be used to change the default dice pool size for characters with certain talents.\r \r Thanks to Jakob for the Text Expanding Area CSS and plexsoup for the working tabs.",
