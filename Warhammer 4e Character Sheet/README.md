# Warhammer 4e Character Sheet (Djjus) 


///// ============ About this Sheet ============ /////  


This is a fork of https://github.com/vicberg/Roll20-Warhammer-4e-Character-Sheet, which itself is a port of a original Havoc roll20 WHFRP2e sheet. 

This Character Sheet has been updated to fix and enhance mostly in the original style. And uploaded to Roll20 for all to use.  
I'm a active WFRP player and I plan to further enhance this sheet at time goes on. 

This sheet attempts to simplify the WFRP 4e Core book rules into a workable mostly automated roll20 sheet, without the need to track too many variables manually. This is accomplished by a combination of detailed manual configuration for each character, as every character is different, and a highly integrated and standardized roll template. Including uptodate offical companion and expansion rule (TEW/UiA/WoM/AotE..), and options for certain custom house rules.

Optional Custom WFRP4e token marker set 4 is available @ https://github.com/Djjus/Vault/raw/master/Warhammer%204e%20Character%20Sheet/markers/WFRP4eset4.0.zip // UiA Edition @ https://github.com/Djjus/Vault/raw/master/Warhammer%204e%20Character%20Sheet/markers/WFRP4eset4.0%20(UiA).zip. Follow Roll20 Token marker update instructions for your server.

The sheet should work on latest version of Firefox, MS Egde & Chrome. at 110-125% Magnification. 

Please report issues on Github or Discord : Justi#7934
  

///// ============ Main Features ============ /////  


- Mainhand / Offhand / Ranged with active weapon selection system. with integrated integated Skill, Talent & Quality mechanics. 

- Combat Roll Modifier Quick Menu dropdown for Melee and Ranged, mod calculator with dymanic situation (Def Stance/Called Shot/Reach/Size/xVsy/Prone) and talent +SL/lvl integration (Stirke to Stun/Infighter/Fury..). Talent trigger's will onyl show if learned.

- Skill system, Basic / Advanced Skill List is fully implemented. 

- Talent system, all Core+++ official talent integrated into roll system. Add SL to all outcome and automatically add up for total outcome. Integrated into sheet Charactistics, Carry Weigth etc, and Movement Rolls from the Action bar and and Quick menu's.

- Item Qualities system, Weapons, Armor and Damage absorption system with Qualities, Enc, AP, Durable, Damage, Damage point & Talent integration. 

- Integrated SL results for all rolls, which aids in the manual calculation of opposed rolls (due to underlying limits with Roll20 full Opposed SL resolution is not a straight forward matter for now, i have chosen the visual self-calculated approach while providing the maximum possible information options for talent and other bonuses.) 

- Roll Tables for Critical / Oops / Mutations (TEW extended tables) / Miscast & Wrath of the God integrated, also traggerable from clicky buttons in the roll template output when they occur.  

- Magic system with separate Magic/Channeling types, all 8 colors, Witch, Dark, Chaos and a Misc for custom spell Lores. includes Spell book system, with core book spell/blessing/miracle name list, plus optional custom spell names. Intgrated core spell talent modifiers (like, atheryic attunement and instinctive diction) and including miscast management and clickies in the roll template output. Additionally, advantage can be disabled for spells in the settings tab, allowing for seamless integration the Unofficial Grimoire rules (@ https://pdfcoffee.com/unofficial-grimoire-12-pdf-pdf-free.html).

- Full combat Advantage & Condition Tracking, per core rules. Tracked by sheet attribute and integrated to automatically modify roll tamplate output and all Roll Target displays across all core / skill / weapons and magic tabs. Including Group Advantage rule option to disable roll intregation!

- Inventory: Full Encumbrance Management system, with integrated Over encumbrance modifiers (-move/Agi), and Container & Vehicle Management section (TEW compatible) . 

- Manual and Auto XP recording options.

- Custom Roll outcome modifiers allowing player to tie custom text and other bonuses to roll out comes like success/failure/always.

- Custom NPC tab, on sheet area to quickly add NPC for GM and players alike. Not meant to replace a full character sheet, but handy for quick trash mob types. The idea is to make a full char sheet for the "boss" and to have his henchmen as Custom NPC's on the NPC tab.  

 
///// ============ Usage Notes ============ /////  


- Settings: Check setting (cog) tab ever time when setting up any new Char sheet for all players, and select correct options for your game. 
- Wounds: ensure correct Race and Hardy level are chosen. Wounds are subtracted by adding damage, and given back by subtracting it. Wounds can not exceed Max Wounds limit. 
- Advantage Field applied to Attacks and appropriate Combat Skills (Cool & Dodge) automatically, and shows in the roll template output. 
- For an advanced Skill you must select the taken checkbox in order for target to go above 0. 
- Adv fields add advance point to skills, this value are automatically added to the roll target as SKILL. 
- Weapons/Spells Mod fields, allow players to pre-populate the roll modifier popup box and is only available with . 
- Weapons/Spells Target fields, display the final roll target including all variables calculated by the sheet at that moment, e.g. CHAR + SKILL + MOD + ADVANTAGE - CONDITIONS. 
- On Weapons ensure you select the corresponding skill (e.g. Melee Basic, Melee Parrying, Ranged Bow, Ranged Black powder etc), and that the correct skill is learned with advance points in it. 
- Themes, see setting tab for various theme which change the look of the char sheet overall. Including Empire/Dwarf & Elf themes. 
- Extended Channeling Test (spell book tab, Arcane Spells only), set Accu Ext SL to 0 before beginning a new Channeling action. Increment with Success level of roll until finished. Allows easy tracking of CN v Accu Ext SL for all players. 
- NPC tab is intended of quick persistent and contained NPC creation without the need for full character sheets for each of them. With template integration, semi featured with contained Name / Characteristic / Condition / Advantage integration and up to 5 weapons & spells for each NPC, and a collapsible notes section. Good for GMs and players. (I would still recommend separate character sheet for actual NPC bosses/major characters).  
- Condition Tracking integration into roll template. Option to choose between Advantage +xx showing only on all combat rolls and all (new default v1.3) non-situational roll modifying conditions (e.g. Broken, Fatigued Stunned, Prone..) to be add to appropriate rolls automatically. Includes NPC tab support too.  

This sheet has TokenMod integrated (TokenMod API needs to be install in the game!) buttons which can set/unset conditions, it does requires my custom WFRP4e Tokens v4 @ https://github.com/Djjus/Vault/raw/master/Warhammer%204e%20Character%20Sheet/markers/WFRP4eset4.0.zip // UiA Edition @ https://github.com/Djjus/Vault/raw/master/Warhammer%204e%20Character%20Sheet/markers/WFRP4eset4.0%20(UiA).zip

Condition effects are currently hard coded as follows (updated June 15th 2021): 

Broken/Fatigued/Poisoned/Stunned = Effects all roll tests (this excludes non test rolls and roll tables like Initiative/Miscast/Crit/Oops etc.). 
Entangled/Prone = Effects WS/BS/I/AGI/DEX characteristic rolls, all combat, and any skill that would require movement like dodge/athletics/climb etc.
Blinded = Effects WS/BS/AGI/DEX characteristic rolls, all combat/magic, and any skill that would require sight like art/dodge/drive/perception etc. 
Deafened = Effects I characteristic rolls, and any skill that would require hearing like Perception/Intuition.
Unconscious = Effects all rolls except endurance (Blocks rolling actions essentially) 

Multiple conditions: You can be subject to the same Condition more than once; indeed, sometimes you will receive multiples of the same Condition from a single event. If this occurs, any penalties suffered are stacked. So, if you have three Bleeding Conditions, you’re losing a worrying 3 Wounds per Round; or if you have 3 Fatigued Conditions, you suffer –30 to all Tests. You can also be subject to multiple, different Conditions at once. When this occurs, the effects do not stack; you suffer the highest of the two penalties and apply it. So, if you had 3 Fatigued and 2 Broken Conditions, you would suffer a –30 penalty to all active Tests, not –20. 

Note conditions are not intended for out of combat situations, GM simply makes the roll difficulty harder with a custom roll modifier (-20 etc) if any particular condition is to apply to a situational roll.

December 6th 2021 v1.53.1

- Completed experimental talent list (all 166 talents) in the Dev mode, nearly all are implemented at this time. This causes talent bonuses to show when rolling skills and weapons, to allow superior flow of game and especially combat. Includes advanced combat actions, like Charge/Furious Assault/Feint/DW/Fast Shot etc rules which are implemented directly into the sheet so they show when rolling ( i.e. you don't have to remember at the +SL or complex rule). Also includes a new SL system which adds together the total SL bonus each roll. Enable Dev mode to test this feature.

File available @ https://github.com/Djjus/Vault/blob/master/Warhammer%204e%20Character%20Sheet/markers/WFRP4eset3.1.zip. This is Optional.

Miracle Damage also adapted to match, but without the WPB modifier.
- Houserules are no longer seperated main PC and NPCs on the same sheet. The settings options now configures both.

July 5th 2021 v1.5

This will calculate all XP on the fly after Talents or Advances are entered in the sheet. Special Xp circumstances like free/starting XP or changing career/level need to be added manually to the "Other XP" section in the XP tab. XP calculation is capped at 50 skill advances/10 talent levels as descibed in the core rules, advances above this will not count toward the overall spent total. You can not mix Auto & Manual modes at the same time, but you can switch between them at anytime.
- Made Armor Penalties on Perception and Stealth rolls visible on the Rolltempalte so it clear that they are being applied.
- Fixed some advanced skill target numbers which were calculating conditions twice.

June 14th 2021 v1.41

- Full rework of condition system, which now scales fully with all PC/NPC rolls and immediately modifies all roll target windows on the skills tabs. 

Condition effects are now hard coding changed: 

Broken/Fatigued/Poisoned/Stunned = Effects all roll tests (this excludes non test rolls and roll tables like Initiative/Miscast/Crit/Oops etc.). 
Entangled/Prone = Effects all combat/spell cast, and any skill that would require movement like dodge/athletics/climb etc. Includes WS/BS/S/AGI/DEX rolls 
Blinded = Effects all combat/magic, and any skill that would require sight like art/dodge/drive/perception etc. including WS/BS/S/AGI/DEX rolls.

- Reroll clicky buttons now integrated into the roll template out put for most rolls, including all repeating sections. This is displayed in the Test value row. 
- NPC Tab rework, a number of modifications have been made to increase it performance when alot of NPC hare created. All NPC rolls are now integrated into the crit and reroll buttons. Weapons have been split into Melee(upto 3)/Ranged(upto 2) and Spell into Magic(upto 3)/Prayer(upto 2). Notes now no longer has a hider checkbox and is always shows and the Roll outcome modifier are removed entirely, both were to greater performance hogs within the repeating section. Use the quality text field instead.  
- Channeling Roll template has been altered to be more inline with other rolls to allow the reroll integration. 
- Weapons & Spells Tab rework, cleaned it up and added a Mod and Target display fields which matches the roll target. 
- All Mod fields will now prepopulate the Roll Modifier popup with the set value. 
- Fixed the Talents tab text field dragging issue from the last update. 
- Armor Tab rework: Separated AP from Armor Damage points and added field to add Durable value to increase Damage Points only without increasing AP. Also added a Robust talent lvl selector which modifies the right hand body location total AP display. 
- New GM whisper button in the Combat Actions title row, and adjusted matched the Conditions hider button to match it. 
- The sheet will perform a repeating section ID scan and set them as attributes inside the sections on first opening after this update to populate the required ID's of existing sections to allow new features to function correctly. There is a check to only allow this to happen once as it does take a few seconds to complete. 


December 28st 2020 v1.3 

- Roll Modifier Text: Most roll buttons now have a optional configuration cog next too them allow players to add text to the roll template output (can be conditional on test outcome, ie success/fail). This includes Skills/Weapons/Spells & NPC tabs. Handy for adding text related to Talent based roll outcomes, i.e. +1 SL on success or Reverse Result on fail. 
- Skill Tab rework, decluttered Melee/Ranged/Channelling/Language Magick Specializations groups, these skills are now hidden by default and have to be checked to be visible. Removed the Cast group, Language Magick is now in Language group, and Pray is now a ungrouped advanced skill. 
- Crit/fumble logic update: Auto Failure on 99 roll result, will always result in a fumble, even if target is above 100. 
- Renamed critical success/failure to auto success/failure, so not to confuse with critical hit. 
- Roll template now has Critical / Fumble(Oops) / Miscast / Wrath buttons integrated, they only show when these events happen and are useable by anyone with control of that character sheet. 
- Advanced Skills will now always have base skill 0 (unmodified) when they are not Taken (i.e. trained). This is intended to prevent any untaken advanced skills to be rolled by accident. Note Ranged Crossbow and Ranged Thrown are always rollable as per core rules. Also fixed Rt header display for advanced grouped skills which will now display the user entered name field as well as the grouped skill name. 
- Marginal fail rolls (-0) will now show correctly in SL results 
- Corruption Section now has a Max Corruption value field, based on TB+WPB.

- Continued adding IL8N tags that were missing from a lot of the new content. This work is now mostly complete. 
- Workable Italian translation is now implemented (Translation credit to Andrezzo/Roll20). (change language to Italian on Roll20 website/account config, then start server to see it). I am more then willing to work with others to implement more languages, but can not do this by myself. 

  
September 7th 2020 v1.22 

- Fixed issue which stoped the Initiative button from working correctly on a newly created character sheet.

NEW - Expandable Packs, Containers & Vehicle section added under Inventory Tab. Allows for simple separation of carried and non-carried items, in Packs & Vehicles. Separate weight calc built in.

- Weapons Tab overhaul - Weapons must now be selected to use them, and will fire of from the new Attack/Opposed/Shoot buttons. This should be fairly obvious when the Player next tries to use a weapon after this update. This feature is supported by new sheetworkers. This allows using weapons outside the Weapons reaping sections which is the main reason this was implemented. 
- Combat Actions section overhaul - Added custom roll field, core rule based movement rolls for Athletics/Climbing/Falling/Leaping/Pursuit/Sprinting in drop-down menu, current active Attack/Opposed/Shoot display and buttons which are underpinend by the new Weapons mechanic.

June 29 2020 

- Buttons & Banners further improved look 
- Combat Initiative roll now allows Modifier for the Init Char. 
- Crit Roll fixed so it doesnt go negative. 
- NPC tab reworked, look improved, added Condition tracker section and 2 custom skill rolls 
- Condition Tracking integration into roll template, first pass. Option to choose between Advantage +xx showing only (new default) on all combat rolls and all non-situational roll modifying conditions (e.g. Broken, Fatigued Stuned, Prone..) to be add to appropriate rolls automatically. Includes NPC tab support too. It should be noted that some conditons can we highly situational, like Perception test could be impacted by Blinded/Deafened or not depending on what is being percived, such situational occasions will have to be handled by the GM and no attempt is made to add complication.  

Condition effects are currently bound as follows: 

Broken/Fatigued/Poisoned/Stunned = Effects all Melee/Spellcast and skill rolls (only excludes roll tables like Misscast/Oops etc.) 
Entangled/Prone = Effects Movement based rolls, so melee/spells, combat actions and any skill which would require movement like dodge/athletics/climb etc. 
Blinded = Effects Weapon/Spells casts rolls 
Deafened = Effects Spells casts rolls 
Unconscious = Effects all rolls (Effectively blocks rolling with buttons) 

Note conditions are not inteneded for out of combat situations, GM simply make the roll difficulty harder (-20 etc) if any condition is to apply to a situation.
