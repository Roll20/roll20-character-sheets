# Warhammer 4e Character Sheet (Djjus)

This is a fork of https://github.com/vicberg/Roll20-Warhammer-4e-Character-Sheet, which itself is a port of a original WHFRP2e Template.

This Character Sheet has been updated to fix and enhance mostly in the original style. And uploaded to Roll20 for all to use. 
I'm a active WFRP player and I plan to further enhance this sheet at time goes on.

Dec 2019

- Reworked Initiative Roll button, with 3 Core book rule options. See Settings cog.

- Rework of Spellbook Tab. Removed unused 2e spell sub tabs. Spells now work correctly and added Channelling Test button for Arcane spells.



Usage Notes:

- Wounds: ensure correct Race and HArdy level are chose. Wounds are subtracted by adding damage, and given back by subtracting it.
- Advantage Field applied to Attacks and Combat Action Skills automatically.
- For an advanced talent you must select the taken checkbox in order to roll.
- On Weapons ensure you select the coresponding skill (Melee Basic, Melee Parrying or Ranged Bow or Ranged Blackpowder or other Melee or Ranged Skills)
- Spells need to have a number in CN and Damage Field or they will not roll correctly, both fields will default to Zero.
- Extended Channeling, set Accu Ext SL to 0 before beginning a new Channelling action. Increment with Success level of roll until finished. Allows easy tracking of CN v Accu Ext SL for all players.
