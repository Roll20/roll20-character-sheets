  "instructions": "Character sheet for Exile Game Studio's *Hollow Earth Expedition* series including *Secrets of the Surface World*, *Mysteries of the Hollow Earth*, and *Revelations of Mars*.\r\rThe sheet design did not consider other Ubiquity powered games.\r\rThanks to Exile Game Studio for providing the official Hollow Earth Expedition logo for this sheet.\r\r### Usage\rFill in the text inputs with scores and play!\rHover over text inputs for some hints. Auto-calc fields are kept to a minimal since Talents can change how scores are derived.\r### Wound Tracker\r* Click on a pip to cycle between lethal (pistol), non-lethal (fist), and healthy (empty).\r* Mark damage such that the bottom-most filled pip indicates your current health.\r<u>Example</u>:  Commander Dobson with Health 4 gets slugged for 2 points of non-lethal damage. Toggle the pip next to 3 and 2 to each show a fist. His current health is now 2.\r\r### Modifier Prompts\rThe sheet will present a dialog to ask for roll modifiers for every roll if modifier prompts are turned on. This may be convenient for players, but GMs may wish to leave this off.",
