# Character Sheet for the Generic Universal Roleplaying System(GURPS), 4th Edition

## To the Future Authors - from Mike W (12/20/2018) - Updated 03/24.2020
I need to mention that the original author(s) misspelled the words Miscellaneous (as Miscellwneous) and Encumbrance (as Encumberance) in both the CSS and HTML files. Rather than write extensive code to fix this, I just corrected the cosmetic portions only. Also note that the original author(s) use the word Fear in place of Fright although the proper word to use is Fright. As with the misspelled words, I changed no code other than the cosmetic side. This seemed simpler then spending hours writing code, transferring values from the attributes in question, and making sure it still functions. It also avoids having to explain it to the users in case they used those misspelled attributes in homemade macros.
## We also ask that you not favor GCA or GCS over each other. They both work fine but should have nothing to do with how this sheet functions. If you are designing an Importer sript, then that is different and lets all work together.
