This sheet is made for use within Roll20 for the game Sentinel 
Comics RPG which will be on KS this Summer 2018. An exciting 
fast and streamlined Super-Hero RPG! Fantastically blending 
elements of story with mechanics. Definitely more story driven
but the tactical gamers will have a blast for sure as their 
hero is challenged!
