    "instructions": "The Forbidden Lands sheet includes a dice pool roll template(thank you Wes). Optionally, Pro subscribers may choose to use an API dice roller instead. The 'Forbidden Lands Year-Zero Die Roller' script must be installed to use the API-based roller. To use the dice pool, simply select an action button e.g. Skill, Weapon, etc. to automatically select the correct number of Attribute, Skill, and Gear dice to roll. Adjust dice pool as needed and press the 'Roll' button to roll the total dice selected.  Dice can manually be selected and rolled directly from the dice pool as well.  Pushing a roll will require manually selecting the appropriate number of dice before rolling."
