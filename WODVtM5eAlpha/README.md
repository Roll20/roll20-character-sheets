Character sheet for Vampire The Maquerade, 5th Edition (Alpha) by White Wolf Publishing.

Most credit goes out to Matt Zaldivar, Brian Shields and Benjamin Bandelow. I used the Matt's VtM 20th Edition sheet as basis for this one, with was credited to Brian Shields and Benjamin Bandelow for their original exhalted sheet. Cheers to everyone.

Will propably be replaced by a proper sheet once 5E comes out, as this is only based on their 5E ALPHA release. More or less just a striped down version of the CWOD V20 sheet. Rolling from sheet is not complete but now the sheet should look at least barely functional.
