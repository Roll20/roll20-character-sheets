As a result, the sheet may appear to be rolling 1d8+1, or not rolling at all, when it's really rolling 1d10. Behind the scenes, this is what the sheet actually does with skill rolls:\n\n1. It rolls 1d10 to see if it gets a fumble or a crit.\n2. If it gets a fumble, it rolls 1-1d10.\n3. If it gets a crit, it rolls 10+1d10.\n4. If it gets neither a fumble nor a crit, it rolls 1d8+1 (to generate a number between 2 and 9).\n\nStatistically this works out correctly for skill rolls in Cyberpunk Red.",
