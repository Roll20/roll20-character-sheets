OVA Character Sheet
==========================

This character sheet is designed to be tabbed for ease of navigation. One tab (Stats) contains all the Abilities, Weaknesses, Attacks, etc., and the second tab (Misc) contains the background information and areas for notes.

The sheet contains a field for the number of dice that should be rolled as well as a button that rolls the correct number of dice and displays them using a roll template. Roll buttons in the Attack section have also been added.
