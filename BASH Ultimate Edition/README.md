BASH: Ultimate Edition Character Sheet
======================================

This character sheet is designed for ease of navigationâ€”everything is on one sheet, with a similar layout to the standard BASH character sheet.

Roll Buttons: Brawn, Agility, Mind, Agility Specialized Roll, Mind Specialized Roll, Stat of 0, and Powers, are all roll buttons. Merely click the word to roll the dice. It is anticipated that Brawn, Agility, and Mind would be used for skill rolls that aren't specialized. In addition, each weapon has it's own roll button for rolling damage.
