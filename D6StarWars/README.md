# D6 StarWars Character Sheet

This is the Character sheet for the D6-Based  WEG Star Wars and the new D6 Star Wars games. The sheet is geared to 2E and REUP as the rolls use wild die, but the option to disable wild die is now included so 1E gameplay should be comfortable now.
If you're looking to play "30th Annniversary Edition" or "1E", the sheet by the name "Star Wars 30th Anniversary Edition"(author: Claes) is another option.

List your dice and pips next to the appropriate skills -  3pips equal another die.
The text areas are expandable for additional info.
