While this api is not required, you will lose out on intended functionality if you don't use it.  The api can be added via a game's Settings \/ API Scripts page.\r\n\r\nI would also recommend using the [HeroTracker API](https:\/\/github.com\/Roll20\/roll20-api-scripts\/tree\/master\/HeroTracker).  This api is compatible with this character sheet and adds some useful features for handling the HeroSystem turn mechanics (segments\/phases)."
