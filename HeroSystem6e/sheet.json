While this api is not required, you will lose out on intended functionality if you don't use it.  The api can be added via a game's Settings / API Scripts page.\r\n\r\nI would also recommend using the [HeroTracker API](https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-api-scripts/tree/master/HeroTracker).  This api is compatible with this character sheet and adds some useful features for handling the HeroSystem turn mechanics (segments/phases).",
