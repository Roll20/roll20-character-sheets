Character sheet for Mage the Ascension, Second Edition, revised, by White Wolf Publishing.

I still need to figure out how to do the Quintessence wheel.

I need to figure up a better way to do the health tracker, so it can reflect the different types of damage.

A big thanks goes out to Brian Shields and Benjamin Bandelow.  I used the exalted sheet they made as a starting point and as such much, maybe most, of this code it theirs.

Thanks to Lithl for some help with the quintessence wheel.  Still need to iron out the formatting but progress has been made.
