Functional 13th Age Sheet

Important field data for macros. 

@{STRMOD} represents the strength mod on its own.
@{STRMODLevel} is the same mod with the current level attached

This works with str replaced with any 3 letter stat abreviation (Dex, CHA, etc)

I reccomend using [[]] around these fields when added to your macros or else you see the whole math formula in the roll.
