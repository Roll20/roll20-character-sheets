  "instructions": "## Arkham Horror\nCharacter sheet for the Arkham Horror board game by Fantasy Flight Games.\n\n### Edit and Display Modes\nIn the top-left corner of the sheet is a toggle button to switch between Edit mode and Display mode.\n\nIn Display mode, you can only edit a character's *current* Sanity and Stamina, and move the selector on the character's sliders.\n\nIn Edit mode, you can edit all of the character's information. If you set the character's Sanity/Stamina to Variable, a fourth slider will be available in Display mode. If you choose an option from the \"Predefined Investigator\" select box, the other fields will automatically be filled appropriately, except for \"Investigator Name\". If the character already had any \"Abilities\", the existing rows will not be deleted. Additionally, any selection for \"Predefined Investigator\" will make the Display mode show the appropriate character portrait, while choosing the blank option from the dropdown will set the portrait to a generic shadow. If you want a custom character with a portrait, choose the predefined portrait you want with the \"Predefined Investigator\" selection, and then update the character's other values as you see fit.",
