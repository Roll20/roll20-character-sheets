Any an all input will be appreciated, especially in regards to improvements.\r*First Tab: The busiest tab. The radio buttons, checkboxes, tabs, arrow buttons...basically everything awesome on the sheet, was originally designed by Brian, and displayed here: https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/882997/css-wizardry#post-1460538.  Check it, there is much awesome.  The radio buttons fill from the left, the health boxes rotate from non-existent boxes, to undamaged, to bashing, to lethal, to aggravated, back to non-existent.   \r*Second Tab: Mostly expanded sections for more elaborate details.  \r*Third Tab: Special note to the selector switch on the level of the blood bond, and to the tiny triangle off to the side of the expanded merits section: clicking it will reveal the a lot of text areas.  \r*Fourth Tab: History, description, and general character information.",
