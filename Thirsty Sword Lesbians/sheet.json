Please note that a new character sheet may take several seconds to render the first time, leaving that tab blank while the sheet populates all of its data. If you run into any issues, have suggestions, or anything else, please reach out to Evil Hat at feedback@evilhat.com. You can learn more about TSL at http://sword.gay &mdash; If you're a sheet developer and looking to make changes to this sheet's code, don't. We maintain an external copy as the authoritative source; problems that emerge with the sheet are our customer service problem, not yours. Changes you make are likely to be erased. So talk to us before making changes.",
