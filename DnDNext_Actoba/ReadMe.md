# DnD Next Character Sheet

This character sheet was built for the last playtest packet released for DnD Next (Oct 2013) for use on [Roll20.net](http://roll20.net).  The sheet is no longer actively maintained and is NOT compatible with the full 5e release rules.  If you need a sheet for a 5e game please use the [5e sheet instead](https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-character-sheets/tree/master/DnD_5e).

This sheet started as a reworking of another DnD Next sheet authored by David L. Hawkins (@The Story Teller)& Aaron C. Meadows and that original sheet can be found [here](https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-character-sheets/tree/master/DnDNext).
