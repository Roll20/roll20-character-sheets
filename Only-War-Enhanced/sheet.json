	"instructions": "This sheet is designed for use in Roll20. It is based on the Warhammer 40000: Only War ttrpg by Fantasy Flight Games, and derived from the Halo Mythic 3.5 Roll20 sheet made by Omran Losinno and Michael van Weelde.\r\rInfographic has information about Wounds, Fatigue, and Fate Pts. If this information is invisible when the sheet is first loaded, try clicking the Infographic button twice.\rTo GM toggles a whisper function. If enabled, all rolls will only be visible to you and the GM.\rInline Mod toggles a query for situational modifiers. For example, a Dodge check in thick mud carries a -30 penalty, which would be noted in the Inline Mod. In situations where many checks are made with no modifier, leaving this option disabled may streamline gameplay.\r\rWords or symbols in the sheet that don't make sense might have a tooltip explaining their function if hovered over.\r\rIf you have any questions about the sheet, feedback, or feature requests, please feel free to PM the author at https://app.roll20.net/users/685637/sammy-silver",
