Please try to make sure there is a plain number value (and any appropriate + or - signs) in fields used for the weapon macros. \n\n* Rolltemplates are available to use with your custom macros. For descriptions of the macros and instructions on how to format macros to utilize them head to the [Template Guide](https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/4614691/advanced-2nd-edition-simple-sheet-instructions-for-using-new-ad-and-d-2e-rolltemplates) \n* Roll Templates \n- 2Edefault - behaves very much like the standard roll20 default template with a few optional features. Such as adding a subtitle, and adding descriptive text fields. \n- 2Eattack - A template designed for comprehensive weapon attack resolution. It even includes optional support for critical hits and fumbles. \n- 2Espell - A nice clean template for displaying spell information. Includes fields for all of the standard 2nd edition spell attributes and an area to describe the spell effects. Also has optional attributes for easy damage and healing resolution. \n- 2Esave - This template handles saving throw rolls in a clear and concise manner, and circumvents a quirk of the dice engine which fails when attempting to make a comparison against a negative number."
