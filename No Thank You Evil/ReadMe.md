Based on David Hawkins' Numenera sheet.

This sheet was fairly easy to design. Since No Thank You, Evil! is very streamlined, it was just a matter of porting the very similar Numenera sheet and renaming the pools.

I'm sure others will have ideas and methods on improvement, and I look forward to seeing them.
