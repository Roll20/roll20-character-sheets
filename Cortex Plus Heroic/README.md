<h1>Cortex Plus Heroic Character Sheet</h1>

<p>
Initial functionality is the dice pool roller. For the CLEAR button to function, the sheet requires the ChatSetAttr API. The first half is a dice bar that can be added to the top of your character sheets to provide the dice pool rolling functionality. The second half is a larger version of the dice pool tool that uses the entire character sheet. This can be added as a tab for multi-page character sheets, or used in lieu of character sheets if you're not using them for your characters.
</p>

<p>
Plan: Create a comprehensive character sheet with button clicks that manipulate the dice pool, such as clicking a trait die to add it to the pool or even more complex ones such as clicking an SFX that adds a d6 to the pool and steps back the highest die at roll time.
