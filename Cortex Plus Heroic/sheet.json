The first half is a dice bar that can be added to the top of your character sheets to provide the dice pool rolling functionality. The second half is a larger version of the dice pool tool that uses the entire character sheet. This can be added as a tab for multi-page character sheets, or used in lieu of character sheets if you're not using them for your characters."
