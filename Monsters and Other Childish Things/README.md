Monsters and Other Childish Things Character Sheet
==================================================

This character sheet is designed for ease of navigationâ€”everything, for each character type (child vs. monster), is on one sheet, with a similar layout to the standard Monsters and Other Childish Things character sheet.

Roll Buttons: Roll buttons have been added will sort and group all rolls.

The sheet also supports "weird" skills.
