PENDRAGON character sheet
=========================

This sheet is for Pendragon 5.1 edition.

It is divided in several tabs.
MANOR tab refers to Book of the Manor supplement.
PEOPLE tab refers to Book of Entourage supplement, but allows you to keep track of your family and squire anyway.

Some fields are missing, as distinctive features, because i think this information must be displayed on Bio & info tab of Roll20 character box.

Current HP is calculated with HP carac, current wounds and religious bonus.

Religious bonus are actives, except for wotanic religion.

Have fun !

## May 2019 Update
### author - @dstack1776
Getting ready for a Pendragon campaign, I made a few adjustments to this sheet. Specifics:
- Options for Pict Heathen and Arian Christians added (both in religion dropdown and possible trait bonuses)
- Previous versions of the sheet made part of the British Christian religious bonus include +2d6 bonus to damage. That was an error - they should get a straight +2 to damage (like the Arian Christian bonus includes +3 to damage). The Wotanic/German Pagan Religious Knight __does__ get +1d6 to damage (as indicated in the _Book of Knights and Ladies_.
- I renamed the religions slightly to match the _Book of Knights and Ladies_.
- Getting the +2 or +3 religious damage bonus for British or Arian Christian Knights added to damage rolls added a ton of intermediate output so I did not include them in damage dice rolls. I instead added a box indicating "Rel Dmg Bonus" which should be mentally added to any damage roll. (This is clearly an area for enhancement - if your html skills are greater than mine, feel free to - I'm more an html dabbler with a background in software development).
- Under wealth, I added a box for shillings.
- The html code had a lot of references to "enemy" attributes. I maintained consistency with that code but in all honesty I could not find it being used - I'm guessing the intent was for there to be an "enemy" tab. 


Potential enhancements:
- Fix religious damage for Arian and British Christian religious bonuses.
- The current sheet expects a fairly wide window - it could probably be made a bit more flexible.
