    "instructions": "This character sheet represents player characters for the Ryuutama system. It does not provide details about classes, skills, or mechanics, but does an intuitive dice roller that automatically takes into account benefits from class, type, weather, condition, and terrain and the penalties associated with being overburdened and suffering from conditional status effects. The sheet contains a tab for inputting meta information about characters, a tab for tracking experience points and statistics (derived attributes are automatically calculated but can be overridden), a tab for inputting class, type, weapon mastery, and skills/spells, and a tab for inventory management that automatically tracks current and maximum item and water capacity."
