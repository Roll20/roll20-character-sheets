	"instructions": "Loot has 3 radio buttons, in this order. Equipped, Unequipped, Not Filled.  Stat bonuses are totalled and placed in the roll buttons for each stat.  ie if Strength has Loot +2, Base +1 and Lifeform is +3, the strength roll button will be 6.  Base and lifeform can be filled in. Loot is calculated from the loot table.  Likewise, defense is also calculated as 10+loot.  Hero Coin is a simple numeric field, as is dying.  Abilities, power and augments are simple text description fields.  The NPC sheet works similarly, except all of the roll bonuses are manual entries.  PC roll templates are black, NPC are Red.  ENJOY!",
