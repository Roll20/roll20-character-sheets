This is a character sheet for Osprey Games' Jackals by J. M. DeFoggi (@DefoggiJM).  He was not consulted on the design so far so there may be changes that he suggests based on his greater knowledge of the system.  If so I will do my best to add those promptly.

My first attempt at this sheet was originally based on the Barebones Fantasy sheet by Justin M. Gordon from several years ago, but as almost nothing of that original sheet is retained I have not listed Justin in the sheet json authors or instructions sections.

This version of the sheet uses div and span functions for layout, unlike the original sheet which used the table function.

Anyone who would like to make an improvement or base their own sheet on this one is welcome to do so without my permission, although if you reach out to me on twitter (@pellamwasteland) I would love to see your work!
