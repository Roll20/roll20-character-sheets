All the relevant attributes are set up so that they can be displayed as a bar on a token (Valor, Mettle, Clash, Wounds, and Devotion are all set up this way).  It also has rollable buttons for all common rolls in the game.  I would like to thank the Roll20 community for their wiki work and tutorials and forum posts, as all three were immensely useful in creating this sheet.",
