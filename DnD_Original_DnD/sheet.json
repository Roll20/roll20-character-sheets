  "instructions": "# Original Dungeons & Dragons Character Sheet\n\nPlayer sheet for Original Dungeons & Dragons by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson, the 1974 original edition and any combination of supplements you like.\nThis sheet also works well for Holmes Basic Dungeons & Dragons edited by Eric Holmes (sometime called Blue Book D&D).\n\n\n## Player Sheet\n\n* This sheet is lacking automatic roll buttons as a feature, to allow for maximum flexibility for the DM.\n* While it is tempting to add attack rolls, this assume use of the Alternate Combat System rather than Chainmail.\n* Similarly, ability checks are not added as there are multiple ways to adjudicate ability checks (3d6 roll under, variable number of d6, roll under a d20, and more).\n\n\n## Current Version: 1.3"
