    "instructions": "**Fallout 3.5**\rWhole Sheet: I changed skills like repair, science, outdoorsman and speech. Then created many skills for them. I did that because skills like science can be very tricky. Hacking was under it, craftings were under it. So now they have own skills. Animalism for animal handle, tame and helps you with skining and helps communicate with animals. Armorsmith for both armor crafting and making some outfit, Repair stays the same as before. Robotics for Robot knowledge and crafting. Computer Science now has hacking and computer use mechanisms. Electronics skill created for purposes of pure crafting. You can craft any electronic item with the help of Smith skills. And so on... \rPrime Tab: Included height value for character and changed sp per level value for purpose of supporting increased amount of skills. \rSkill tab: Fixed some bugs for earlier 3.0 sheet and added 11 new skills along with tag skill. So tagging skill will increase that skill for 20 points. All skills have their own category in the Skills tab, like all speech-like skills will stay together. So you can find any skill easily. \rTrait tab: Changed the name of this tab as perks. \rInventoryTab: Location name has changed with amount."
