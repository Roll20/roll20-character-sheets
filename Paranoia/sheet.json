The GM button only sends it to the GM.\r\r## Secrets\r* A place for all your secerts.  Every button here sends the information straight tothe GM.\r\r## Equipment\r* This is where equipment is kept. .\r\r## Combat\r* Wounds are checkboxes, and each attack button includes a GM only option.  You can change the catchphrase.\r\r## Communication\r\r*I am very pleased withthis tab.  Open comms sends text to everyone, while the friend computer is just to Friend Computer.  The GM button does the same thing, and the Private message whispers only to whoever you put in the input box.  The private messages is also in a repeating field, so you canput the whole crew in there.",
