## Getting help & providing feedback

If you have question, need help or would like to provide feedback, you can:

- Ask on the [unofficial Ars Magica 5th Discord](https://discord.gg/9M9fhwr6T9)
  in the `#roll20-vtt` channel. Tag `@Riernar`. This is ideal for quick questions.

- Open an issue in [Roll20's sheet repository](https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-character-sheets/issues).
  Include `[Ars Magica 5th]` in your title and tag `@Riernar`.

- Open an issue in [Riernar's own repository](https://github.com/Riernar/arm5-sheet)
  where I develop the sheet. This is where I schedule up-coming features, so be sure
  to check here if you have a feature request: maybe it's already in the work !
