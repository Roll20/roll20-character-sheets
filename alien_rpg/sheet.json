  "instructions": "This is the official Alien RPG Roll20 character sheet. It includes drag and drop integration with the [Alien RPG Compendium](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/Alien%20RPG).\r\n\r\n## Editions\r\nThe sheet supports both first edition and second edition with specific roll mechanics and attributes. The two editions also have specific color modes, although the color modes can be used independently of the editions by setting the sheet to use the Roll20 dark/light mode toggle; light mode will use the 2nd edition colors and dark mode will use the 1st edition colors.\r\n## Roll Templates\r\nIf you want to build your own macros using the sheet's roll template, you can use the roll template by using the `&{template:alien}` template call. See the [Roll20 wiki for more general information on using roll templates](https://wiki.roll20.net/Roll_Templates).\r\n### Template Fields\r\nThese are the roll template fields that can be used in a generic macro. Note that there are additional fields not outlined here that are not usable in custom macros.\r\n- `{{character_name}}`: This specifies the text that is displayed at the top left of the template output.\r\n- `{{character_id}}`: This specifies the id of the character. Combines with `character_name` to create a link to the indicated sheet. Has no effect unless `character_name` is passed as well.\r\n- `{{title}}`: The large text title of the roll. Usually the weapon or skill name when sent from the sheet.\r\n- `{{successes}}/{{panic}}`: Used by the sheet to indicate how many successes/panics were rolled.\r\n- `{{d66}}`: Used by the sheet for outputting the result of a d66 roll. In custom macros, has no special handling beyond standard Roll20 inline roll handling.\r\n- `{{stress_roll}}`: Rolls on the 1e stress roll table.\r\n- `{{base_dice_#}}`: A base dice roll. Each base die is rolled in it's own field, e.g. `{{base_dice_1=[[1d6]]}} {{base_dice_2=[[1d6]]}}`. Numbering starts at `1` and can go as high as `30`. Base dice are displayed as dice images using the Alien dice.\r\n- `{{stress_dice_#}}`: Stress dice rolls. Same as `base_dice_#`.\r\n- `{{base_damage}}`: The base damage value of an item. If passed, will be combined with the label `base damage`.\r\n- `{{results}}/{{comment}}/{{description}}`: Text entry displays. Each one is displayed in it's own container. Contents can be any combination of raw text and inline rolls.\r\n\r\n## Help & Support\r\nIf you need help with the sheet, find a bug, or have other questions or comments, please submit a support ticket via the [Metamorphic Digital Support Portal](https://support.metamorphic-digital.com/)."
