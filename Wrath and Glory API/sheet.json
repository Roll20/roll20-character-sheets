  "instructions": "**Wrath & Glory (with Advanced API Integration) v3.1**\n\nThe W&G API sheet is for the revised edition of Wrath & Glory.  The previous version of this sheet supports the original edition.  This is a multi-purpose sheet for both characters (default view), threats, vehicles, and voidships.\r\r A core philosophy behind the design of this sheet was to automate as much of the manual calculation around dice pools and crunchy mechanics to give players the ability to focus on the game and not how to execute the mechanics. \r\r##Features\r\r* Automated calculations of base ratings - if you are using variant rules or equipment that modifies a particular value use the +Adj for static vaules (Attributes, Traits, and Skills). \r* Ability to add additional dice (bonus die) or modifier to a given roll (roll mod).  Note I do not use the pop-up to add modifiers as this slows down play as you switch windows. \r* The ability to add custom skills.  \r* Automatic calculation of additional wrath dice when the character is Dying (Dying checkbox is checked) and the character takes trauma.  \r* Ability to roll a d66, a d6, or a d3 (under rolls). \r* Progression Tracking with automated summing of XP.\r\r## Dice Rolling\r\r*This Wrath & Glory character sheet provides automated dice rolls using the Roll20 Inline dice rolling and integration with the **Wrath and Glory API Dice Roller**.  To use the API die roller you need to be a pro subscriber and select the **Wrath & Glory Dice Roller** in the API scripts.  While standard dice rolling is supported on this character sheet; it does not support the specific dice mechanics in capturing 2 successes with a 6 - this is a limitation of Roll20 with no known way to codify.  The API Dice Roller has the ability to calculate number of successes based on the number rolled as well as additional functionality such as adding +1 on all die rolls with specific weapon feats but is not necessary to use this sheet.  To use the Roll20 dice rolling mechanics, make sure to have the **Use Inline dice(vs API)** checkbox checked at the top of the character sheet. \n\nIf you have any questions, comments, or feedback (all welcome) please contact Barry at btsnyder@gmail.com or MrBS on Roll20.",
