  "instructions": "The One Ring 2nd Edition. This is based on the 1st Edition sheet, then reformatted to resemble the released TOR 2E character sheet and work according to its rules. In version 2 of the sheet, roll logic is performed in a roll parsing function. This can be turned off in the sheet setting 'Use parsed rolls' or on the sheet itself. If this setting is turned off (unchecked), then and only then will the below be necessary to make the table based rolls work. \r\rthe Check boxes by the skills are to highlight whether a skill is favoured or not, but it is the radio buttons under Roll Types that actually effect the rolls. \r\r**Important:** For the rolls to work properly, follow the instructions on [The One Ring wiki page](https://wiki.roll20.net/The_One_Ring#Rollable_Tables) to set up custom rollable tables for your game.\rMore info: [Readme](https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-character-sheets/blob/master/The%20One%20Ring/README.md) and [wiki page](https://wiki.roll20.net/The_One_Ring).",
