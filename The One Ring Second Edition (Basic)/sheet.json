  "instructions": "The One Ring 2nd Edition. This is a cobbled together version based on the 1st Edition sheet.  The formatting is not the greatest, but I'm just trying to get a workable sheet up that will do all the dice rolls. The Check boxes by the skills are to highlight whether a skill is favoured or not, but it is the radio buttons under Roll Types that actually effect the rolls. \r\r**Important:** For the rolls to work properly, follow the instructions on [The One Ring wiki page](https://wiki.roll20.net/The_One_Ring#Rollable_Tables) to set up custom rollable tables for your game.\rMore info: [Readme](https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-character-sheets/blob/master/The%20One%20Ring/README.md) and [wiki page](https://wiki.roll20.net/The_One_Ring).",
