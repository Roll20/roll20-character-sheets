	"wits": "Wits",

	"valour-description": "Valour is a measure of a character’s courage, as tempered by dangerous deeds. A man of valour is willing to place himself in danger for the safety of others. In a time where new threats arise each day, courage is highly prized, and a valiant adventurer is often esteemed above all other individuals. For this reason, a hero’s rank in Valour also reflects the level of renown he attained as a doer of great deeds.<br><br>When a player decides to favour Valour over Wisdom, his hero’s actions, not his judgement, will tend to prove his status in the eyes of others. From the lowliest start as a wandering adventurer, a hero might one day equal the repute and respect earned by a famous champion or king.",
	"wisdom": "Wisdom",

A characteristic with deeply personal implications, a hero’s rank in Wisdom also determines the stature of the hero in the eyes of those that prize these qualities.<br><br>When Wisdom is chosen over Valour when spending Experience points, it suggests that the hero’s adventures are affecting him subtly but profoundly. Starting as a more or less ingenuous individual with an adventurous spirit, the hero can achieve the maturity and sagacity of the Wise.",

	"skill-groups": "Skill&nbsp;Groups",
	"awe": "Awe",
	"awe-description": "This skill measures a hero’s capacity to provoke respect in onlookers, and determines the impression a hero makes on someone he meets for the first time. Depending on the circumstances and the hero’s intentions or disposition, it can be used to instil wonderment, admiration, or even fear. <span class='sheet-strong'>Awe</span> arises from a character’s native charisma, but can also be engineered with a dramatic entrance or impressive attire.<br><br>A successful use of the skill provokes the chosen effect. A failure fails to have any impact, or can even lead to the opposite result! Achieving a great success means that the hero has won the hearts of the onlookers, or cowed them into silent submission. An extraordinary success may produce open reverence, or panic.",
	"inspire": "Inspire",
	"inspire-description": "A hero able to <span class='sheet-strong'>Inspire</span> others can instil positive feelings in others, urging them to act on the matter at hand. This is a feat achieved mainly through example, charisma and personal conviction, rather than through the effective use of words (which falls under <span class='sheet-strong'>Persuade</span>, below). It can be used on individuals, but is especially effective in influencing crowds. Heroes with high <span class='sheet-strong'>Inspire</span> ratings can be forceful orators, passionate agitators, and well- loved leaders of men<br><br>A successful <span class='sheet-strong'>Inspire</span> roll awakens a chosen feeling in the subject, so long as it is not in opposition to their current mood. A great success is enough to influence wholly disinterested individuals, and an extraordinary success may turn rivals into supporters.",
	"persuade": "Persuade",
	"persuade-description": "This skill allows a hero to apply his or her reasoning to convince another individual of an idea or course of action. It can be used to influence small groups of listeners, but only if used in an appropriate context, such as a common hall. An attempt at persuasion requires more time than other Personality skills, but can have a more lasting impact on other characters’ actions. A high <span class='sheet-strong'>Persuade</span> score denotes an uncommon eloquence, a love of speech and knowledge of its proper use and its effect on listeners. Wise men, advisors to chieftains and kings and their messengers all share this passion for the spoken word.<br><br>The successful use of the skill lets the hero convince his audience of the flaws in their current position. A great success convinces the subject of the quality of the hero’s stance, while an extraordinary success may turn the subject into an ardent believer.",

	"athletics-description": "<span class='sheet-strong'>Athletics</span> is a broad skill, covering most of the physical activities that a hero might undertake while adventuring, including r unning, leaping, climbing, swimming and throwing stones or other small objects. Heroes with high <span class='sheet-strong'>Athletics</span> skill scores exhibit a winning combination of physical prowess, grace and control, generally gained through continuous exercise and daily exertion.<br><br>A successful <span class='sheet-strong'>Athletics</span> roll produces a satisfactory outcome in the physical activity, while a failed roll might even lead to serious harm, depending on the circumstances. A great or extraordinary result suggests a spectacular achievement.",
	"travel": "Travel",
	"travel-description": "In the Third Age, the cities, villages and towns of Middle- earth are often separated by many leagues of wild or deserted areas. Roads that used to lead safely to distant realms now end in broken trails that go nowhere.<br><br>When the company needs to cover a distance across uncertain territory, including by boat, every companion is required to perform one or more tests using the <span class='sheet-strong'>Travel</span> skill to avoid becoming weary too soon. While certainly the product of exper ience, the use of Travel benef its mostly from a hero’s strength of spirit.",
	"stealth": "Stealth",
	"stealth-description": "A hero resorts to <span class='sheet-strong'>Stealth</span> whenever he needs, or is forced, to act in a furtive or secret way. The skill includes hiding, moving quietly and shadowing others. These activities often rely on quickness and precision, so a stealthy hero combines practiced caution with the ability to judge the right moment to take a chance. Hunters, burglars, and solitary fighters use <span class='sheet-strong'>Stealth</span> to prosper in their trade.<br><br>A successful <span class='sheet-strong'>Stealth</span> roll indicates that the character has gone unnoticed, while a failure has almost certainly attracts unwanted attention.<br><br>A great or extraordinary success produces an outcome so flawless that it even be impossible to trace the hero’s actions after the fact.",

A hero with a high <span class='sheet-strong'>Insight</span> score is often recognised as being a sensible and discerning individual, and many might seek his counsel. A successful <span class='sheet-strong'>Insight</span> roll provides the hero with a faithful, if partial, portrait of the character observed. A great or extraordinary success reveals truths about an individual of which he himself is ignorant. <span class='sheet-strong'>Insight</span> tests may be rolled in opposition to an adversary using <span class='sheet-strong'>Persuade</span> or another Personality skill.",
	"search": "Search",
	"search-description": "<span class='sheet-strong'>Search</span> is used when trying to find something by close examination. This skill may let a hero search a library to locate a piece of relevant information, look for concealed doors or hidden inscriptions, recognise a familiar face in a crowd or even search a suspected thief’s clothing. One roll is required for each inspection of a small area, such as a room. <span class='sheet-strong'>Search</span> rolls are generally initiated by the player rather than the Loremaster; <span class='sheet-strong'>Awareness</span> is used to see if the characters passively notice something. A successful <span class='sheet-strong'>Search</span> roll generally lets the characters find what they are looking for if it is to be found. A great or extraordinary success usually means the object is found more quickly. If an item is particularly well hidden, the Loremaster could decide that a higher level of success is required to uncover it.",
	"perception-description": "The ability to catch hidden details often pays off, be it noticing an odd noise that gives away an ambusher, catching the gleam in the eyes of a liar or spotting the crack in the wall that reveals a secret door.",
	"explore": "Explore",
	"explore-description": "Adventurers rely on their <span class='sheet-strong'>Explore</span> skill when they move through an unfamiliar area of the Wild. An <span class='sheet-strong'>Explore</span> test may be required during a journey to find the company’s heading, or to get back on track after a detour; to cope with adverse weather conditions or other natural hazards; to create paths through the wilderness suitable for others to follow; or to choose a suitable place to set up camp. A high <span class='sheet-strong'>Explore</span> rating is an invaluable resource for a companion acting as a scout for his group of adventurers.",

Almost all traditions, however, agree on the treatment of serious injuries, which must be immediately tended to keep from worsening.<br><br>The <span class='sheet-strong'>Healing</span> skill includes bone setting and the use of herbs or salves, but the outcome relies on the ability of the healer to understand what ails the sufferer and determine what should be done.",

It can also be used to learn new works or create original compositions.",

Observing these traditions demonstrates respect and is a way of quickly establishing a friendly footing even with complete strangers.<br><br>A hero succeeding in a <span class='sheet-strong'>Courtesy</span> roll knows what to say at the right moment to make a good impression with their host, or is mindful of his manners when receiving guests.",
	"riddle": "Riddle",
	"riddle-description": "Owing its name to the ancient Game, the <span class='sheet-strong'>Riddle</span> skill represents a hero’s ability to draw conclusions from seemingly unconnected scraps of information, by deduction, reasoning and intuition.<br><br>An adventurer also relies on <span class='sheet-strong'>Riddle</span> whenever he is forced to talk about a subject but wants to conceal part of what he knows, for example to explain something about himself without revealing his true identity.<br><br>An accepted custom among many creatures, speaking in riddles is usually allowed among strangers meeting for the first time who want to speak guardedly. This skill is also used to gain helpful insight from a spoken or written riddle.",

	"craft": "Craft",
	"craft-description": "The <span class='sheet-strong'>Craft</span> skill doesn’t really cover the whole range of abilities of smiths, wrights and other artisans, but reflects the talent of a character for making or mending things by hand, although Traits like Smithcraft or Woodwright can be used to reflect proficiency in a specific craft. Craft could be used to attempt to repair the wheel of a cart, or construct an improvised raft with wood found on a river shore, or even when trying to start a fire on a windy hill.<br><br>A high <span class='sheet-strong'>Craft</span> score may indicate that the hero was a craftsman before starting his life of adventure. Some races, such as the Dwar ves and Noldor Elves, revere crafts as the highest expression of creativity.",

	"lore": "Lore",
	"lore-description": "<span class='sheet-strong'>Lore</span> expresses a hero’s love for learning, be it a fascination with descriptions of distant lands, or an interest in family genealogy. Whenever an action involves knowledge of some kind, a <span class='sheet-strong'>Lore</span> roll is required. Heroes are considered to be knowledgeable in the traditions of their own people, and so the Loremaster should rarely require a player to make a <span class='sheet-strong'>Lore</span> test for information regarding their character’s culture, background or the area they originally come from.",
