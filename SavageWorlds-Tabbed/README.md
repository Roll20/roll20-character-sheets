Savage Worlds Tabbed Sheet
==========================

This character sheet is designed to be tabbed for ease of navigation. All of the Core Rules Skills (as found in the Savage Worlds Deluxe Edition) are included in the sheet but hidden by default.  You can reveal the different skills you need for a given character by clicking on the Configuration link at the top and checking each of the skills you would like to be visible on the character sheet.  This functionality is separated between Mooks and Wild Cards.

The sheet  contains an Ally/Mook character sheet that can be accessed by clicking on the button in the upper left-hand corner of the character sheet. The button will toggle (when clicked) between Wild Card (default) and Ally / Mook.  The Ally/Mook version is a streamlined version of the sheet and the buttons exclude rolling a Wild Die

The Sheet has a GM button that can be used to roll the dice to the GM instead of making it public.

The configuration functionality may be expanded in the future to incorporate different settings, but that is pure speculation at the moment.
