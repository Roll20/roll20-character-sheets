   "instructions": "# Character Sheet\rInspired by Actoba's D&D 5E sheet and herrozerro's Savage Worlds sheet (with a special mention to Sam Marino for a spiffy json file).\r\r## Configuration\r\rIn the configuration section you can:\r\r* **UI Tweaks**\r  * Elect to show dice icons instead of drop down menus.\r      - This feature is only available for Attributes, Skills, and the Wild Die.\r      - It is not available in the Repeating Sections (though I hope to make it available in the future).\r      - The dice are color coded: d4=Red, d6 & d8=black, d10=blue, d12=green.\r      - The enhanced Trait Die Type Drop Down Menu uses the same field names as the regular drop downs, which introduces a risk for potential data loss. To minimize risk use only the standard textual drop down menu OR make periodic notations of all Trait ranks.\r        + **NOTE:** I've not experienced any problems (except with repeating sections, which is why this hasn't been implemented there yet. But, fair warning.\r  * Quest Font Type allows you to choose a handwriting font for the Quest Log section of the character sheet. To select a font, hover over the selection to the right of the Quest Font Type\r  * The Arcanum and Vehicle tabs can be hidden (they are shown by default)\r* **Game Setting Configuration**\r  * Additional Game Settings\r    - You can choose to add various fields to your character sheet to match your settings.  Settings supported so far include:\r      + All For One\r      + Deadlands\r      + Hellfrost\r      + Hellfrost: Land of Fire\r      + Interface Zero 2.0\r      + Lankhmar\r      + The Last Parsec\r      + Necessary Evil (and other Supers settings)\r      + Pirates of the Spanish Main\r      + Tour of Darkness (and other horrific settings)\r    - Additional settings and fields will be added as opportunity and demand allows. I hope to incorporate as many different Savage Worlds Settings as possible.\r    - There are three different Configuration "areas" to support different different game settings: Additional Derived Stats, Field Name Replacements, and Additional Setting Fields\r    - Additional Derived Stats\r      + Corruption\r      + Fame\r      + Firewall\r      + Glory\r      + Grit\r      + Neural Toughness\r      + Sanity\r      + Strain\r      + Street Cred\r    - Field Name Replacements\r      + Money\r        * Clams\r        * Credits\r        * Lankhmar currencies\r        * Livre\r        * Pieces of Eight\r      + Character Name\r        * Code Name\r      + Race\r        * Species\r      + Rank\r        * Threat Rating\r    - Additional Setting Fields\r      + Archetype\r      + Augments\r      + Engrams\r      + Fency Styles & Schools\r      + Homeworld\r      + Languages\r      + Max Load Modifier\r      + Motivation\r      + Occupation\r      + Permanent Injuries\r      + Ship Name\r      + TAP Readout\r      + Worst Nightmare\r* Backgrounds\r  - Choose a background image for your character sheet. Current available backgrounds include:\r    + Blank white sheet\r    + Cyberpunk\r    + Hellfrost-like\r    + Hellfrost: Land of Fire-like\r    + Last Parsec\r    + Noir\r    + Old Map\r    + Parchment\r    + Superhero\r    + Zombiepacalypse\r  - Additional backgrounds will be added as opportunity and demand allows.\r* Logos\r  - Choose a logo for your character sheet. Current available logos include:\r    + Savage Worlds Deluxe\r    + Savage Worlds Deluxe (Bloodied)\r    + All For One\r    + Deadlands\r    + Deadlands: Noir\r    + Deadlands: Hell on Earth\r    + Hellfrost\r    + Hellfrost: Land of Fire\r    + Interface Zero 2.0\r    + Lankhma\r    + The Last Parsec\r    + Necessary Evil\r    + Pirates of the Spanish Main\r  - Additional logos will be added as opportunity and demand allows.\r* Skills (Wild Card and Mook)\r  - All skills from the Savage Worlds Core Deluxe rules are included in the sheet, but are hidden by default. To manage them, click on the "+/- Core Skills" button on the Skills tab (right above Fighting) and place a check mark next to each skill you'd like to use.\r  - The sheet supports the optional Skill Specialization rule. To manage this, click on the "+/- Core Skills" button on the Skills tab (right above Fighting) and place a check mark next to "Use Skill Specialization"\r  - Fencing Styles and Schools are supported. click on the "+/- Core Skills" button on the Skills tab (right above Fighting) and place a check mark next to "Fencing Styles & Schools"\r* All Trait dice are limited to the standard d4-d12 dice. To accomodate certain Edges that allow one to have a trait die type that has a permanent modifier (ie Professional, Woodsman, etc.) use the modifier box to the right of each Trait die type.\r\r## Attributes & Skills\r\r* You can mouse over just about any field to get its attribute name.\r* All field titles follow Roll20's attribute syntax, ie. Agility would be displayed as \"@{agility}\" on mouse-over.\r\r## The Wild Die\r\r* The Wild Die is a configurable field to allow for Edges (such as Master) that may alter the Wild Die.\r\r## Rolls\r\r* You can mouse over any button to get its ability name.\r* Roll button titles DO NOT follow Roll20's ability syntax, using the selected token, ie. \"%{selected|STR-check}\", but will only show the attribute displayed like \"@{AgilityRoll}\".\r* The gm button uses the exact same formula for rolling as the regular button, but will whisper the roll to the GM.\r\r## Character Sheet\r\r* The Character Sheet view can be toggled between Wild Card and Mook using the button in the upper left-hand corner (default is Wild Card)\r* The Mook sheet is a stripped down version of the Wild Card sheet and does not roll a Wild Die for Trait Rolls.\r* The character sheet supports the DealInit API Script by providing a a field in the Configuration window where the various initiative altering edges can be represented.\r\r## Additional Notes\r\r* Most Repeating Sections have a \"Hide Macro Formula\" checkbox. Unchecking it will review a the formula to be used to create macros that simulate the roll buttons in repeating sections.\r* Apply Encumbrance Checkbox (in the skills sections) can be checked to automatically apply any Encumbrance Penalties to a particular skill roll. The standard skills already care for this automatically.\r* If there's something you want added, or you'd like to report a bug, please contact Finderski in the \"Character Sheets\" forum (putting Savage Worlds in the title will help me notice the post more readily, but isn't strictly necessary).\r\r## Special Thanks\r\rI'd like to thank the following for their help in the development of this sheet:\r\r* Shane Hensley (for giving permission to use all the Savage Worlds Settings Logos)\r\r\r---\r\r* Actoba\r* herrozerro\r* Brian (CSS wizard)\r\rI stole a lot of css/html from them\r\r* Everyone in the character sheet forum"
