  "instructions": "This sheet is designed for use with the Burning Wheel system written by Luke Crane and produced with permission for use on Roll20. Much of the Character Burner process has been enhanced with auto calculating values and many of the final results translate to the rest of the sheet.\nHovering over most of the Stats & Skills will reveal with underlying Roll20 Attribute names. Roll by clicking on the white D6 next to Ability names in order to make use of the roll template. In the roll query you'll be asked for a Help, FoRKs and other Advantages (depending on the Ability), Artha dice (from Persona or Deeds expenditure) which add to the roll but don't compare to the Obs difficulty, and the base Obstacle of the test. The 4-point star symbol to the upper right of an ability exponent mark's the roll as Open Ended and will cause any 6s rolled to explode.\nEnjoy!\n\n[Read Full Documentation](https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-character-sheets/blob/master/Burning%20Wheel/readme.md)",
