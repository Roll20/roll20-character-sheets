# Star Wars 30th Anniversary Edition

A character sheet for the 1st edition of the D6 Star Wars Role Playing Game.

## Instructions

If you hover over the Star Wars logo a popup with instructions will appear. They are shown here as well.

### Dice Codes

Dice codes must be written as xD or xD+y. For example, 2D and 2D+2 are valid. Damage codes for weapons can use str (Strength) and ctrl (Control for lightsabers), e.g. str+2D.

**Important!** For a dice code to update you need to tab away from the field before you press a roll button. This is due to that the roll buttons use hidden input fields where D is replaced with d6.

### Armor Codes

Armor code must be either a value with a plus sign, for example +1; or a normal dice code like 1D.

### Wound Status

The dropdown has the following values:
- H = Healthy
- S = Stunned
- W = Wounded
- I = Incapacitated
- M = Mortally Wounded

W, I and M will reduce all dice codes with 1D. H and S will revert back to normal dice codes.
