    "instructions": "This sheet is for John Harper's Agon Role Playing Game (Agon-rpg.com).  Recent updates inlude resizing many page elements, fixing some elements, and shifting column contents around to improve usablilty. Also added a number of features: \n* Added NPC and Minion sheets, as well as a GM sheet for saving quick rolls. (click \"PC NAME\" for dropdown). \n* Ability scores can now have a +1 or +2 bonus included. \n* An Ability Roller - the title of each Ability is a button to roll that Ability. This button automatically rolls the Ability, the Name Die, and asks for any other dice (enter a valid die string like 1d6+2 or 1d10+2d6). \n* A Custom Die Roller at top right: just enter a dice string (like \"1d8+1d6+2\") and click the title to roll. \n* A combat die roller - enter the dice in the Left Hand and Right hand boxes (e.g. 1d6+1d8+1d10+1) and click the title to roll them. \n* a Bonus Die roller, for open-ended rolls, and any simple 1d4, d6, d8, 10, or d12 rolls. \n* The Ability Roller buttons automatically include the Name Die, while the combat and custom die rollers do not. \n* When making an Ability roll, the die rolled will take Impairment levels into account. For custom and combat rolls, you'll need to enter the correct die size.  \n* Wound Penalties are included in Ability and Combat rolls. Temporary wound modifiers (for Wounds 1-3) are applied; after making a roll, uncheck the \"Clear Temporary Penalties\" box to remove the penalty. \n* The Armor Die will be automatically calculated - just click the pieces worn (greaves, helmet, breastplate). Bonuses boxes are provided in case you gain armor better than standard. As with Abilities, Armor rolls take Impairment into account. \n* Finally, your Name Die is automatically calculated from Fate boxes.  \n\n "
