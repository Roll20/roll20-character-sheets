Each button is coded (to the best of my knowledge) to match VTM5e rules. The MISC section provides an area for custom rolls, this is useful for Discipline rolls that you will have to remake. As you can't select the disciplin in the Trait 2 combo box, please use the second set of custom rolls and type the value in manually. On pressing the COTERIE button a second set of headings will appear. It is recommended that the ST has one character sheet shared with all players, so they may all type the coterie details into a single sheet. By default Chrome (and likely Firefox) will stop the custom font, at the right of the address bar in your browser is a shield. If you click the shield and select Load unsafe scripts, this will provide access to the custom font. NOTICE: This sheet is usable without the Compainion API for those who do not have access to this. All rolls will need to be set up in the 'Rolls' part of the sheet under 'no-script rolls'."
