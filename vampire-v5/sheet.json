The Check-box toggle at the top of the sheet allows for toggling between Standard In-line Rolls and Rolling with the API. Each sheet is set to roll with the Inline, non-API rolls by default. API rolling requires a Pro-level subscription. When using Inline rolls, place the mouse of the number of successes to see the dice rolled. Importantly when using Inline if your dicepool is 3 and your hunger is 4, 4 dice will be rolled, make sure to remove any extra successes or effects. Each button is coded (to the best of my knowledge) to match VTM5e rules. The ROLLs section provides an area for custom rolls, this is useful for Discipline rolls that you will have to remake. As you can't select the disciplines in the Trait 2 combo box, please use the second set of custom rolls and type the value in manually. On pressing the COTERIE button a second set of headings will appear. It is recommended that the ST has one character sheet shared with all players, so they may all type the coterie details into a single sheet. By default Chrome (and likely Firefox) will stop the custom font, at the right of the address bar in your browser is a shield. If you click the shield and select Load unsafe scripts, this will provide access to the custom font."
