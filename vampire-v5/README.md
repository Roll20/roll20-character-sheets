# Character sheet for Vampire The Maquerade, 5th Edition (v2.4)

## Known Bugs

When running with the API script, errors may occur if the player enters a name with tilde (\~), this is because the tilde is symbol I've used to identify names. There are no plans to fix this as this was introduce to enable full names.

## User Guide and Installation Instructions (Please read)

While this sheet is designed to be as intuitive as possible and to aid in stream lining your game there are several key features which are worth being aware of. As such we highly recommend you read the [VtM 5th Edition Sheet Guide](https://wiki.roll20.net/Vampire_The_Masquerade_5th_edition#Welcome_to_The_World_of_Darkness). The [VtM 5th Edition Sheet Guide](https://wiki.roll20.net/Vampire_The_Masquerade_5th_edition#Welcome_to_The_World_of_Darkness) also contains installation instructions and details about the API script.
