  "advantage_description": "Advantages give bonuses to the TN of subsequent Skill Checks by allies. Creating an Advantage uses up an action in Conflict, and typically requires a Skill Check—for example, distracting an enemy with Guile. If successful, the hero improves the TN of their allies' Skill Checks by a number equal to the Skill Ranks they used. <br /><br />If the Advantage can be made with minimal risk—like stringing tripwire away from the scuffle—then the Advantage can be made without requiring a Skill Check. TN improvement would then be +1 for Advantages impairing enemies' actions; +2 for Advantages completely preventing an enemy action.",
  "approach": "Approach",
  "approach_description": "Approaches represent the hero's aptitude for solving problems in a specific way: whether towards Creative solutions, Careful and detail-oriented approach, or sheer Concerted willpower. They also directly determine how easy a Skill Check can be. Approach Scores range from +0 to +3—zero means no aptitude, +1 is average, +2 is gifted, and +3 is expert. <br /><br />If all Approach Scores are reduced to zero, typically through extensive damage exceeding the hero's Blood or Guts, then the hero falls. Approach Scores are determined at Hero Creation and may be increased through Experience Points (XP).",

Other Skills may be used with sufficient justification and if the target is particularly vulnerable to it. <br /><br />Like with all Skill Checks, Difficulty Modifiers may apply, as well as Assistance, though that requires an ally to declare it as their action for their Turn.

The higher it is, the \"healthier\" the hero is. Physical damage reduces Blood directly; when Blood is zero, any further Blood damage harms Approach Scores directly instead. <br /><br />Blood, like Guts, can be restored by resting and can even vary from day to day. When a hero wakes up from a Long Rest, their player may roll 2d6 plus a Blood modifier determined at Hero Creation. The modifier can be improved with experience points (XP) and also has an impact on how much time Long Rest needs, which is equal to 10 in-story hours minus whichever is lower between Blood and Guts modifier.",
  "bonds": "Kontakte",
  "bonds_description": "Bonds represent two heroes' relationships, and are tracked through big boxes divided in quadrants. Every minor level of Bond fills a quadrant; when four quadrants of a box are filled, that counts as a major level. Having deeper Bonds is helpful and contributes to more successful Assistance during Skill Checks and even Conflict. <br /><br />Bonds can be increased during play whenever a hero accepts an inconvenience for an ally (+1 minor level up to 1st big box/major level) or accepts harm or serious risk (+2 minor levels up to the 2nd big box/2nd major level). Making a permanently life-changing, greatly difficult personal choice or even likely fatal sacrifice adds +4 minor levels of Bond and is the only way to complete the last, 3rd major level of relationship.",

  "conflict": "Conflict",
  "conflict_description": "Conflicts occur when danger is imminent and victory is on the line—such as a tavern fight or even a showdown with courtesans. Conflicts  require unique rules that carefully sequence everyone's actions according to Rounds and Turns. <br /><br />Characters can take one action on their Turn and move up to 2 heights freely; all characters have one Turn per Round. A character's choice of action for their Turn determines when their Turn begins—known as Initiative Category.",

  "damage_description": "Whenever an Attack is successful, it depletes the victim's Blood or Guts—depending on the nature of the Attack—with Damage. Damage is equal to the TN of the Attack, plus any applicable bonuses from Damage items such as weaponry. A +2 mace, for example, adds +2 to total Damage. Damage can reduce Blood or Guts to zero or less; if this happens, the next successful Attack harms the victim's Approach Scores directly.<br /><br />On the other hand, Defense items such as shields reduce the TN of the Attack itself, meaning it also helps reduce the total Damage.",
