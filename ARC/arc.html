TN improvement would then be +1 for Advantages impairing enemies' actions; +2 for Advantages completely preventing an enemy action.

Every minor level of Bond fills a quadrant; when four quadrants of a box are filled, that counts as a major level. Having deeper Bonds is helpful and contributes to more successful Assistance during Skill Checks and even Conflict. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonds can be increased during play whenever a hero accepts an inconvenience for an ally (+1 minor level up to 1st big box/major level) or accepts harm or serious risk (+2 minor levels up to the 2nd big box/2nd major level). Making a permanently life-changing, greatly difficult personal choice or even likely fatal sacrifice adds +4 minor levels of Bond and is the only way to complete the last, 3rd major level of relationship.
