The sheet is fully integrated with the [DCC compendium](https://roll20.net/compendium/dcc).\r\n\r\nThe sheet provides several automations and quality of life features.\r\n## Rolls\r\nThe sheet fully supports modifying your roll at the time you roll it through a modal pop up in the sheet that allows you to modify what dice you are rolling and what modifiers are being applied.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you can roll misfire and corruption from the sheet.\r\n## Compendium Integration features\r\n### Drag and Drop\r\nSpells, equipment, armor, weapons, NPCs and even rollable tables can all be drag and dropped onto the character sheet.When a rollable table is dragged onto an open sheet you will roll on that table and the result will be output to chat.\r\n\r\nNPCs can be dropped directly to the virtual tabletop to create a character for them complete with token.\r\n\r\nWhen you drag and drop a spell onto the character sheet, the mercurial effect of the spell will be randomly determined from the Mercurial effects rollable table. Note that if the result results in a reroll, you will need to manually reroll and apply the result.\r\n\r\n### Character mancer\r\nIf your game has the DCC compendium enabled, the sheet's character mancer will guide you through all the steps of creating and leveling up your character. This includes randomly generating your level 0 character and class selection at level 1."
