Fetures include: Auto-Calcs for Pain Penalties and STAB have been added to accuracy and damage rolls, respectively. Type Weaknesses, Resistances, and Immunities will now auto-populate based on a Pokemon's selected typing. Now that the system uses Battle Rank for accuracy, that will be automatically calculated based on the Battle Rank selected at the top of the Pokemon's sheet. Pokeball rolls have been improved to allow for variable modifiers for Level and Timer Balls. Border colors around the section boxes will now update according to a Pokemon's secondary typing.",
