### Blocked

* Get google-fonts integrated
  - this is broken on current chrome and firefox browsers due to some issues with the R20 proxy
    (see the [R20 forums](https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/1534665/slug%7D) for details, this
    is a long-standing issue, upvote [this](https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/2593284/character-sheets-make-google-webfonts-available-for-use) 
    suggestion to see them implemented.
