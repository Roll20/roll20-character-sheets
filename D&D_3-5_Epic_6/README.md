# Dungeon and Dragon 3.5 Epic 6 Sheet

This is a light and modern character sheet for **Epic 6**, a six level variant of Dungeon and Dragon 3.5.
Instead of overwhelming tables full of modifiers, it uses a smart system of generic modifiers that easily adapt to various situations.
This approach keeps the interface clean and user-friendly while still offering all the functionality you need for a game.
