	"drawacinematic": "Draw<br>A<br>Cinematic!",
	"cinematicname1": "Ally of Convenience<br>(Encountered Characters Only)",
	"cinematiccost1": "<strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Rewrite",
	"cinematictext1": "Any player whose character has the Encountered status can choose to make an alien creature into an ally for the scene’s duration. They may use their unwitting alien ally to escape a particularly troublesome or perilous situation, open a door, undo a lock, operate an escape vehicle, or read a vital piece of text.",
	"cinematicname2": "Bad Dubbing",
	"cinematiccost2": "<strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Rewrite",
	"cinematictext2": "Players with this Cinematic can activate it at an opportune time and the Director will then dub over the alien conversation in English for their benefit.",
	"cinematicname3": "Call the Understudy!",
	"cinematiccost3": "<strong>Cost:</strong> 2 Rewrites",
	"cinematictext3": "A player can use Call the Understudy at any point during the scene, but once she does, the understudy portrays her character until the scene ends. The player can then rearrange the character’s Skills as she sees fit. Any time an Understudy suffers damage, she is incapacitated and removed from the scene. The actual actor shows up for the next scene unharmed.",
	"cinematicname4": "Cheap Set",
	"cinematiccost4": "<strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Rewrite",
	"cinematictext4": "A player with this Cinematic can, once per chapter, call upon some object or set piece to break or fail. A character might crash through a wall, pull a door off the hinges, shatter a car window with a single punch, or bend a metal (cardboard) bar with ease. Alternately, the character can target a device or prop in the hands of another character — a gun misfires, an evil device malfunctions, or a heavy extra falls through the floor.",
	"cinematicname5": "Deleted Scene",
	"cinematiccost5": "<strong>Cost:</strong> 3 Rewrites",
	"cinematictext5": "Once per story, the player with this Cinematic can declare a Deleted Scene. This allows the character to replay or add on to a scene that has already happened, in order to introduce a new element, set up a future advantage, or provide Enhancements to an action. The character using this Cinematic must have been present in the scene that they wish to replay, or make an appearance in some direct or indirect way in the now-expanded scene. For example, the scene might now include a phone call or cutaway to the character using the Cinematic.",
	"cinematicname6": "Fan Favorite:<br>Favorite Hero",
	"cinematiccost6": "<strong>Cost:</strong> 2 Rewrites",
	"cinematictext6": "When a character undergoes a Death Scene, the player can declare the character to be a Fan Favorite. The character’s Death Scene continues as normal, but the character can return the next time Starring a Full Cast is invoked (typically during Wrap-Up), or during the next movie. If a character manages to undergo a Death Scene and then return to action during the same movie, Fan Favorite remains in effect for that character for the remainder of the movie and the character cannot enter another Death Scene. Her Health track cannot get any worse than That’ll Leave a Scar.",
	"cinematicname7": "Fan Favorite:<br>Favorite Villain",
	"cinematiccost7": "<strong>Cost:</strong> 2 Rewrites",
	"cinematictext7": "If the player designates a villain or a supporting character as a Fan Favorite, that villain will return in the sequel, regardless of what happens to him during this movie. The villain might die in an explosion (no body found means he’s not really dead!), get sucked into a whirlpool, or be enveloped in Suspended slime and taken to the watery depths. If the player uses Fan Favorite in this way, every character immediately gains 2 Experience points.",
	"cinematicname8": "Kill the Extra",
	"cinematiccost8": "<strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Rewrite",
	"cinematictext8": "Players who choose this Cinematic start play with a supporting character attached to their own. A sidekick of sorts, who participates in their misadventures without being too closely involved with the party. However, should their character come into immediate danger of death, the star can activate their extra to take the hit.",
	"cinematicname9": "Omniscient Narrator",
	"cinematiccost9": "<strong>Cost:</strong> 2 Rewrites",
	"cinematictext9": "This Cinematic can only be invoked for one character per story. Once a character invokes it, they are the Narrator for the duration of the film. Narrators have the ability to describe what is happening on screen, and more, importantly, why it is happening. During narration, dialogue can still occur (though it isn’t always audible to the audience), and the Director can have other players make rolls for their characters. Generally, though, if the Narrator says it, it happens. If the Director wants to change the Narration, they must add a point to the Writer’s Pool and call for a Rewrite, telling the Narrator what needs to change in their last line.",
	"cinematicname10": "Rear Screen Projection",
	"cinematiccost10": "<strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Rewrite",
	"cinematictext10": "With this Cinematic, a character can declare any trip that might conceivably have a rear-screen projection “safe” — even if the characters are driving through hell. Any attacks that happen during such a trip disable or damage the vehicle, but not the passengers. The player can declare Rear Screen Projection to be in effect at any time during a travel sequence.",
	"cinematicname11": "Scene Missing",
	"cinematiccost11": "<strong>Cost:</strong> 3 Rewrites",
	"cinematictext11": "A player with this Cinematic can use it, once per story, to get out of whatever sticky situation their character is currently in. The character and any other player-controlled characters in the scene cannot be harmed, killed, or otherwise made to suffer direct damage. The scene ends (and the appropriate title card flashes on-screen), and then the film resumes with the characters unhurt and in a new situation some time later.",
	"cinematicname12": "Starring A Full Cast: The Introduction",
	"cinematiccost12": "<strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Rewrite",
	"cinematictext12": "The first time all of the characters are together and interact with each other, the group can activate this Cinematic to add one Rewrite per character to the Writer’s Pool. This requires that every character has a chance to speak, that everyone is together and interacting (rather than everyone being the sample physical space but paired off and cross-cutting between smaller groups), and that the group as a whole discusses some mutually relevant matter.",
	"cinematicname13": "Starring A Full Cast: Let&#39;s All Pitch In",
	"cinematiccost13": "<strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Rewrite",
	"cinematictext13": "When all of the characters are together and confronted by the same complicated or problematic situation, they can work together to help solve it. This requires that the situation is a problem for all of them, though it doesn’t have to be a problem in the same way. Mechanically, one character acts as the primary actor in solving the problem, setting the dice pool. Everyone else rolls the same dice pool, contributing successes to the overall result. Each member of the group should describe (after rolling the dice!) how their character’s efforts help or impede the group effort.",
	"cinematicname14": "Starring A Full Cast: Wrap-Up",
	"cinematiccost14": "<strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Rewrite",
	"cinematictext14": "When a story ends, the players can choose to employ this Cinematic. All surviving characters must be gathered together, and must discuss, in brief, their experiences during the story and how they have changed. The player is encouraged to display this in the portrayal of the character rather than simply telling the other players. At the end of the scene, each character gains one additional Experience point.",
	"cinematicname15": "Summon the Stuntman",
	"cinematiccost15": "<strong>Cost:</strong> 2 Rewrites",
	"cinematictext15": "A player with this Cinematic can, once per story, call in a stunt performer to undertake a physical action or a series of physical actions on their character’s behalf. The stunt performer isn’t being paid to act, and so cannot speak on camera. As such, their utility is limited to physical feats: running, jumping, swimming, driving, and fighting. Stunt performers can suffer horrific injury, but no wounds or damage transfer to the character.",
	"cinematicname16": "Take Two!",
	"cinematiccost16": "<strong>Cost:</strong> 2 Rewrites",
	"cinematictext16": "Sometimes it’s wise to shoot two different versions of a scene. Actors have chemistry that no one expected, prompting a slight reinterpretation of the lines. A stunt performer breaks a leg, requiring an action scene be scrapped. Whatever the justification, with this Cinematic, a player can require that scene be played twice, with potentially radically different results. This Cinematic can be used once per story. With this Cinematic, a character can start a scene over just as it ends.",
	"cinematicname17": "&#39;Twas Beauty Did Something to the Beast",
	"cinematiccost17": "<strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Rewrite",
	"cinematictext17": "Players with this Cinematic can activate it to initiate a romantic plot or subplot that, with the connivance of the Director, could alter the entire complexion of the conflict going forward. Or it might not. That depends on the motivations of the characters involved. Usually it involves aliens and involves slime.",
	"cinematicname18": "You Dropped This<br>(Encountered Characters only)",
	"cinematiccost18": "<strong>Cost:</strong> 2 Rewrites",
	"cinematictext18": "Encountered characters for whom this Cinematic is played gain an alien artifact at start of play or over the course of play and will always, very conveniently, be furnished with the exact knowledge they need to utilize it. Perhaps the encounter itself imbues the character with the special alien energy needed to fire their weapons or activate their devices."
