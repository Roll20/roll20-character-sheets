# 13G Changelog
## 1.0
* Originally forked from the [13th_Age-neovatar](https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-character-sheets/tree/master/13th_Age-neovatar) character sheet (MIT license).
* Heavily edited and overhauled it's features and design principles.
* The core difference is to approach the sheet from the angle of 'rules representation' over 'rules implementation', so that user customization options are more accessible.
* This includes:
  * Editable top-row character summary labels, and editable headers for most subsections
  * Editable internal macros, dice mechanics, rules, and calculations: brought up to the 'soft-layer'
  * Buttons to hide/show additional ability scores: and the inclusion of several common options from the ttrpg community, plus a custom option
  * Additional subsection buttons for unusual class options and homebrew styles
  * Toggle between 'Runes' and 'Icons' at will, in case you're not using this sheet to play in the Glorantha setting
  * Lifestyle tab for making lots of custom character notes: great for long-term campaigns!
* Graphical differences include:
  * Larger fonts and thematic type-faces inspired by the Glorantha sourcebook
  * Stone-black headers for clearer section divisions
  * Color-coded macro templates with thematic patterning
  * Cleaner background paper texture and a different logo
  * Custom buttons and checkboxes that loosely resemble common Gloranthan runes:
    * the 'roll macro' button resembles the Fate rune when you hover over it
    * the circular bullets that resemble the Darkness rune, and they turn to Light when clicked
    * the generic square checkboxes resemble the Earth rune, and they turn Maligned when clicked
    * the triangular checkbox for showing macros and game-rules resembles the Law rune when clicked
    * instead of slashes in headers, three I's are used to represent Harmony
  * A commitment to a 'folio style' character sheet, with useful character information separated into two columns on every tab for easier readability
