This is a quick army sheet that I made using mostly HTML for the tabletop wargame "This Is Not A Test". It is basically a mirror copy of the army sheet provided in the rulebook, and the slots should be enough if you are following the army building rules.

If there are any problems or if you want to make it prettier then please feel free to update it yourself, or contact me if you aren't confident editing it.
