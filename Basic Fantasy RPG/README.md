**Official Basic Fantasy RPG Character Sheet**

This is a clean, basic sheet.  It does not contain support for any supplement
rules additions, just official Core Rules data elements, and has the simplest
possible implementation of equipment lists (a textarea) rather than a
repeating-section implementation.  It is not data-compatible with the
"Expanded" sheet, but if you switch to this sheet from the Expanded sheet some
of the data fields will be copied automatically.  At present, support for
packing up the equipment list is absent, and of course, all data elements
related to supplement rules are ignored.
