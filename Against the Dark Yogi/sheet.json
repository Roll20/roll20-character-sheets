This character sheet makes use of the optional dice-based rules found in the Campaign Options supplement. This is due to Roll20 having better support for dice than for cards. If you wish to use the default card-based rules, simply duplicate the poker deck that comes with a Roll20 game, give each player a deck and then manually flip cards and add to the appropriate numbers."
