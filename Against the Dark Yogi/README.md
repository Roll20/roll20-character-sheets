This is a character sheet for [Against the Dark Yogi: Mythic India Roleplaying](http://www.tabcreations.com/site/Against_the_Dark_Yogi)
by Tab Creations.

This character sheet makes use of the optional dice-based rules found in the Campaign Options supplement. This is due to 
Roll20 having better support for dice than for cards. If you wish to use the default card-based rules, simply duplicate 
the poker deck that comes with a Roll20 game, give each player a deck and then manually flip cards and add to the 
appropriate numbers.
