    "instructions": "This is a revised sheet for Advanced Dungeons and Dragons 2nd Edition for both Player Characters and Monsters. The sheet no longer requires +'s in front of numbers except where they already exist. -'s are still needed where applicable. Numerous Skills and Powers sections have been added. As well as Psionics, both versions. Weapons sections have been split to accomodate the introduction of specific modifiers. This sheet has full integration for macro support within many fields of the sheet. Equipment Carried and Gem Value Totals are now autocalculating fields. Please update these trackers by changing a quantity value and then changing it back. If in need of assistance or to report a bug, please send a message to https://app.roll20.net/users/877778/SFX and I will be happy to assist you.";
