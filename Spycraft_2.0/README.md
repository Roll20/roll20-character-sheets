This is a character sheet for Spycraft 2.0, the espionage game system from Crafty Games.

Items are arranged on the digital sheet here somewhat differently than they are in the Crafty games sheet.  This is primarily to make optimal use of repeating sections - sheet areas which have radically optional numbers of useful items are placed towards the bottom of their respective blocks, in order to minimally impact sheet flow.

If anyone should want to make modifications to this sheet, for their own use or for distribution, please take my permission as having been given.
