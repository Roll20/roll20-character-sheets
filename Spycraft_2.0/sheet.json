  "instructions": "This is a character sheet for Spycraft 2.0, the espionage game system from Crafty Games.  Items are arranged on the digital sheet here somewhat differently than they are in the Crafty games sheet. This is primarily to make optimal use of repeating sections - sheet areas which have radically optional numbers of useful items are placed towards the bottom of their respective blocks, in order to minimally impact sheet flow.  Several items have roll buttons attached, primarily weapon attacks and saving throws. I did not deem this worthwhile for the skills area, however, since Spycraft skills are so complex that even auto-calculating them wouldn't be that terribly useful. I was tempted to try dividing up the skills more, giving each stat-modifier its own line, and adding roll buttons to the skills, but decided against this in order to keep the information condensed. This should be trivial, if time consuming, for anyone who thinks that functionality would be helpful to do down the road to do themselves, however.  If anyone should want to make modifications to this sheet, for their own use or for distribution, please take my permission as having been given.",
