# _CY_BORG_ Character Sheet

This character sheet was developed for [_CY_BORG_](http://www.morkborg.com).

To the best of my knowledge/ability, the sheet is set up for internationalization/translation of all text displayed in the sheet and outputted from sheet roll buttons.


## Thanks / Credit

Several Roll20 players pitched in to offer feedback to the sheet as it was under initial development. Thank you very much:
