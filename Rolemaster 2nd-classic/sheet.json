The sheet is compatible with the most options of Rolemaster 2nd and Classic. I plan to add a configuration page for supporting some options. RM2/RMC is all about options so the auto-calculations will remain limited. The character sheet is compatible with the first Rolemaster family (RM1, RM2, RMX, RMC), but is not compatible with the Standard System/Fantasy Roleplaying family.",
