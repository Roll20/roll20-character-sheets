# They Came From Beyond The Grave! character sheet

This sheet has been developed for They Came From Beyond The Grave! Structurally it has been based upon the sheet at the end of the book, although with some minor changes.

Using the sheet is really simple. Fill in the dots for your skills and attributes and just click on a skill name to make a roll using that skill, or click on the d10 (this works for Paths too!). You'll be prompted to select which attribute to use and can enter any extra dice you may have.

Differences to the PDF in the book include:-
--
- Repeating sections for Connections, Trademarks, Quips, Tropes and Favored Stunts.
- Click More to expand an entry to enter more detail.
- Injury checkboxes automatically get ticked when you fill all radio buttons to the right. NB: The last one (Death Scene) doesn't do this for obvious reasons.
- A tabbed section at the bottom to give more space (General, Relationships, Equipment and Notes).
- A toggle on the General tab you can set to whisper all rolls to the GM.
- Repeating sections for Relationships, Equipment and Notes.
- Notes! Never forget what happens in a session of They Came From Beyond The Grave! again!
