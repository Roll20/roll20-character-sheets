This may be something about the setting or a Director-controlled character: As you know, everyone in town says the architect who designed this building riddled it with hidden nooks to spy from; or reveal something about an upcoming event: As you know, Friday’s the full moon and the start of the town’s harvest festival.<br>Alternatively, she may introduce a minor fact about whatever is haunting the party, as long as it doesn’t contradict anything already-established: As you know, the hauntings started thirty years ago when the Smythe family moved into town.

Once the item has been established, any character — ally or enemy — can break the object, use its fragility as a +2 Enhancement, or impose a +2 Complication on the person closest to it.<br>At any point, the Director can add a Rewrite to the Writer’s Pool to declare an item or set-piece as not cheap, and render it immune to this Cinematic.

The Players must describe how their characters went about this. Did they ambush some lone cult members, knock them out and steal their ritual robes? Did they tear their clothing, rub dirt and leaves in their hair, and practice their deadeyed shambling?<br>The characters automatically succeed at completing the disguise, and the scene immediately picks up with the characters moving among the cultists. While moving through the masses, they must make an effort to blend in with the crowd, chanting along with the cultists, bumping mindlessly into other zombies, etc. Breaking character might attract unwanted attention and blow their cover, ending the Cinematic.<br>The Director may add a Rewrite to the Pool to add a Complication (the cultists have a secret handshake), or two Rewrites to impose a Condition (one of the zombies catches the scent of fresh human blood from an Injured character’s wound).",

Maybe love (or at least the making thereof ) really does conquer all ... at least temporarily. Using this Cinematic allows a Player to change the tenor of a scene from horrifying to romantic, or give it an erotic slant. Any danger the participating characters were in is temporarily alleviated, and the next scene those characters appear in, they begin somewhere safe.<br>The Players should discuss and agree upon any Attitude shifts that may occur between or among their characters as a result of this scene.<br><strong>ALTERNATE USE</strong><br>The Player’s character targets a non-Player character to flirt with or seduce. Using this Cinematic grants that character a +1 Enhancement or imposes a Complication on their target on rolls related to their actions. Discuss with the Director what the character is trying to accomplish with their wiles, and determine how their target reacts. For example, a deputy flustered by the Raconteur’s charming patter gives away more information than she intended about the recent spate of murders.

Some or all of the characters who were present in an already-completed scene expand upon it to introduce something new: additional information, setup for a future advantage, or an Enhancement for an action. Any character who was present in that scene may use this Cinematic, even if their original role in it was small.<br>The Deleted Scene’s length is up to the Player. It may be as long as the original scene itself, provide a few new lines of dialogue, or even encompass one brief action. The Player should mention the reason the scene was ultimately cut from the film — whether a last-minute change to the ending rendered the actions moot, or it was cut for time, or the director wasn’t happy with any of the takes and had to move on.<br>A character may take any actions they like within a Deleted Scene. They can move objects around, read a report left unattended on the sheriff’s desk, or make a phone call home to say goodbye in case anything should happen to them. As long as it doesn’t contradict any of the scenes that have thus far followed it, anything goes.<br>If something in the Deleted Scene does threaten to break continuity, the Director may ask the Player how they’d reconcile the differences.

	"cinematictext6": "The situation seems impossible, the characters are under fire, and there’s no way out. Suddenly, the unexpected happens, and the day is saved. The deus ex machina is a narrative device that solves a seemingly impossible situation quite suddenly and not necessarily in keeping with anything else that’s happened thus far. The event always advances the plot, and sometimes introduces a new plot element that the characters must deal with right away.<br>A Player can call for this Cinematic to get herself out of a situation that she just can’t see a way through. A Director controlled character arrives, or an event happens that suddenly solves the situation. Depending on what shows up, the characters may get an advance in the plot as well as getting out of whatever tricky situation they were in<br>When a Player chooses this Cinematic, all the Players decide together what form the deus ex machina takes, and how it resolves. Whatever form it takes, antagonists go away, characters on the brink of death are saved, and tricky situations are cleaned up. Use of this Cinematic doesn’t end the scene, after the situation resolves, the Director decides what new trouble awaits the characters on the other side.<br><strong>EXPOSITION</strong><br>The deus ex machina may come in the form of exposition. The characters gain all the information they would need to solve a puzzle, resolve a mystery, or find an antagonist. Someone came along and gave them all the clues they needed, and now they can move forward.<br><strong>SAVIOR</strong><br>A Director controlled character arrives and solves the problem for the characters. This person is an ally, and someone the characters have never met before. When a savior shows up, she presents a solution to the current scene or situation, but she comes with a new plot twist or mystery for the characters to solve. Sometimes the savior is a mysterious stranger, and now the characters must figure out who she is. Other times, she is an unexpected ally or someone from the background and she presents a new problem for the characters to solve.<br><strong>SURREPTITIOUS EVENT</strong><br>If the Player does not want a person or clues, she may declare that an event occurs that solves the problem with no strings attached. A villain’s coach may suddenly fall off the side of a cliff during a chase. Or the warehouse full of damning evidence against the characters suddenly explodes.",

A deafening crack of thunder and a single brilliant bolt of lightning illuminate a horrific tableau in a terrifying flash. Waves pound against a midnight shore, drowning out the victim’s cries for help.<br>Weather is an effective setting element, informing the scene’s mood. Films often use it to ratchet up tension or evoke emotion, prompting the audience to feel sad when the rain pours down on a funeral, or granting them the relief of a beautiful sunrise after surviving a night of terror.<br>A Player using this Cinematic narrates what the weather is doing at that particular moment: maybe the rain is drumming so loudly on the hovel’s roof it’s hard to hear yourself think, or a sudden gust of wind blows the floor-to-ceiling curtains in an empty room. She uses this to set the Atmosphere for a Drama! action (see p. XX), declaring whether it’s positive or negative.<br><strong>ALTERNATE USE</strong><br>The Player may create a weather-induced +1 Enhancement for her character, such as thunder covering the sound of a squealing hinge as she flees from the killer, or the sluicing rain washing the blood from her eyes so she can aim her gun. She may instead use it to impose a Complication against an enemy. A well-timed lightning strike fells a tree between the character and the monster, or a patch of ice slows his pursuit.",

The underdog is someone who under any normal circumstances should not and could not win against a greater foe. The underdog is David against the Goliath, Jack against the Giant, and that one sports team that had never won before going on to take the trophy.<br>When a Player chooses this Cinematic, the characters become the underdogs in the story, and doing so increases the stakes and the risks, but also increases the rewards. Everyone loves to see the underdog succeed, so when the characters inevitably do so, they rake in all that good cheer.<br>A Player may declare this Cinematic in any scene in which the characters are facing off against Director controlled characters. The characters are now the underdogs, outclassed or outnumbered by the characters in the situation. This doesn’t make the Director’s characters any more powerful. Instead, when the characters defeat the threat, they each gain an additional Experience point. If during the scene any character is in danger of a Death Scene, she becomes immune to further damage until the scene’s end.",
	"cinematicname9": "FRAME STORY",
	"cinematiccost9": "<strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Rewrite",
	"cinematictext9": "The frame story — a narrative device that nestles one tale or set of tales within a larger story — was a popular structure for films of this era. It lent itself well to anthology-style movies, tying unrelated short stories together via an (often thin) overarching plot. Between segments, the host offered up a moral to the story and set the scene for the next. Actors frequently took on multiple roles in those stories, appearing both in the meta-arc and across a variety of characters in the individual tales.<br>Using this Cinematic, the Player cuts the action over to the meta-narrative to state a lesson or mention an insight the character has picked up from the stories so far. Perhaps she’s learned to trust her instincts, or that nothing good ever lurks behind a particular door. The Player chooses a temporary Trademark based on what she’s learned. When the scene-in-progress resumes, count the Trademark as invoked, and as though the Player succeeded on a related action roll. The Player may therefore take Directorial Control at an appropriate moment during the scene.<br><strong>ALTERNATE USE</strong><br>Even if a character’s role is vastly different from one segment of the story to the next, echoes of the lessons they and their companions have learned remain. A Player with this Cinematic may reach back into an earlier chapter of the frame story and borrow a Trope from any of the characters’ prior incarnations for the rest of the scene, even if the current character’s backstory doesn’t match up. A suburban homemaker becomes a crack shot as the werewolf advances on him, or a character out-of-his depth in a conversation makes a stunning logical leap.",

He had a home, a job, a family, all the mundane problems anyone in this town has, and the same blissful ignorance about the monsters in your midst. Then fate put him in evil’s path, and now your neighbor does the devil’s bidding.<br>But some spark of humanity remains within, the fading remnant of who he used to be. He has the strength for one last, heroic act before he’s lost entirely.<br>When their Player uses this Cinematic, a Haunted character brings that spark of humanity to the fore in one of the monster’s minions. She might resemble his daughter, or have exchanged some pleasantries with him when she first came into town. Maybe helping the heroes is his final act of defiance against a cruel and uncaring master. Whatever his role, the Helpful Haunt isn’t long for this world.<br>If no minions have yet been spotted, the Player invents this lone lackey for the scene and offers a brief description of them for the group. The description should include not only what the character is doing to aid them, but who they once were, how they fell under the villain’s thrall, and why they’re helping the characters now.<br>Following are some types of roles such Helpful Haunts might play, though Players and Directors are encouraged to create others as appropriate:<br><strong>I ONCE WAS ONE OF YOU</strong><br>It’s too late for the minion, but not for the heroes. Though instinct tells him to attack the characters, he rallies and resists, helping them instead. While temporarily free of his master’s hold, he may free them from a cell in a castle dungeon, attack his fellow minions, or slip a weapon into the Haunted character’s hands.<br><strong>DUPE</strong><br>Not all Helpers offer aid intentionally; often they’re lured or tricked into doing the characters’ bidding. A nimble party member might act as bait to lure a drone away from his post, or throw a rock in the opposite direction to send the zombie shambling in search of the noise’s source. These characters are potential information sources as well, spilling their master’s beans and revealing a key aspect of their diabolical plans.<br><strong>THE OTHERWORLDLY GUIDE</strong><br>Unfinished business — or the need to be avenged — can pierce the veil. The ghost of a previous victim appears and points the Haunted character to a hidden exit, toward an item of power their murderer wields, or to some other significant object in the scene. For games with less of a supernatural bent, the ghost might be replaced by a victim who everyone believed dead already, rousing himself to point to the murderer’s hiding place before succumbing to his fatal wounds. Or, if they’ve truly already expired, they may have written one last message in their own blood, or died with one hand outstretched toward the object the characters need to see.",

(Sometimes, the missing reel shows up in a dusty warehouse decades later, or goes up for auction as part of a collector’s estate, but those instances are few and far between.)<br>When a Player activates this Cinematic, he declares, “Scene missing — apologies from the studio.” The Director must immediately begin narrating a new scene, putting some temporal distance between the missing scene and the start of the action.

Any characters in that scene exit it unharmed, and no one may be injured or killed in the missing reel. The Director places the characters somewhere else for the start of the new scene, and may not put them in immediate peril.<br>However, anything else that transpired between the missing scene and the start of the next is up to the Director to decide. The Director may move or remove objects. He can declare that whatever happened during the missing scene harmed the characters’ reputations, or got a supporting character hurt.

All attacks the character makes against this opponent gain the Deadly damage tag (p. XX) and increase the damage rating of the character’s weapons by 1.
