First draft of Torg Character sheet (v0.1)

I started off with the basic Fantasy Craft character sheet (thanks to Jason Miller who created it)

I made some modifications, and I'm pretty happy with everything below the top section.

Stats, armor, weapons, equipment and skills all look pretty good IMO.  The name/general info section at the top needs some work, as does the damage section.
