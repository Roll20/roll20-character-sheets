There are also copies of the old html/css before the sheet was redesigned.  Old values not present in the new design should be available in the Attributes section but these old copies of the html/css may be useful to pull out old values if that proves too arduous.  All this can be found at: https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-character-sheets/tree/master/Runequest_6\\nThis sheet can be used with the Luther Arkwright settings if you make the following substitions\\n * Homeland = Parallel Designation\\n * Culture = Sociaological Type & Level of Development\\n * Magic Points = Prana Points\\n * Locale = Home Parallel\\nYou can also use this sheet with the Mythic Britian setting by simply adding the Superstition skill.  I personally just have players add it as a new passion with the base \"(21-@{int})+@{pow}\".",
