	"instructions": "Github has a few versions of this sheet.  An API version which pairs with the extended_autocalc.js script.  This brings autocalc to Damage Mod, Spirit Damage and Fatigue Effects.  There are also copies of the old html/css before the sheet was redesigned.  Old values not present in the new design should be available in the Attributes section but these old copies of the html/css may be useful to pull out old values if that proves too arduous.  All this can be found at: https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-character-sheets/tree/master/Runequest\_6"
