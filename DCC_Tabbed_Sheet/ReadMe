# DCC Tabbed Character Sheet

This is a DCC sheet that uses tabs and Roll Templates.  It also includes a 0-level sheet, and a Monster sheet.  It is the same style sheet as the Mutant Crawl Classics (MCC) sheet.

## Current Version
1.4

### Changelog

#### 1.4
* Fixed misnamed rolls for Single and Multi-Die spell checks.  They should now be able to be dragged onto the hotbar and work.  Old macros will no longer work as the roll variable names have changed.
* Fixed bug where disapproval rolls with a negative luck modifier wouldn't roll
* Fixed unnamed rolls for Level 1+ Melee, Melee Backstab, Ranged, Ranged Backstab rolls so they can now be dragged onto the hotbar as macros
* Fixed unnamed rolls for Level 0 Melee and Ranged attack rolls so that they now can be dragged onto the hotbar as macros
* Fixed unnamed rolls for Monsters for Melee and Ranged attack rolls so that they now can be dragged onto the hotbar as macros

#### 1.3
* Fixed formatting for Melee Weapons
* Added in a 16 melee Critical Threat range for those who dual wield (mostly Halflings)
* Fixed formatting for Ranged Weapons
* Added in Wielded column for Melee Attacks
* Fixed bug with misnamed variable in Monster ranged attacks
* Minimum damage a successful attack does is at least 1
* Made Inventory/Treasure text area's bigger on all 3 sheets
* Arcane casters now have correct "spell slots" section - Number of Known spells and Max Spell Level

* Fixed bug with misnamed Cleric spell die variable name

* Moved Arcane and Divine bonus/minus section from within the Roll Template to a field next to the spell check die.  This allows for people with a more permament mod to have to stop typing it in each time.  NOTE:  Do NOT include the bonus' from Lucky Rolls, Elvish Lucky Spells, Level, Spellburn, or Intelligence here as all of those values are added in elsewhere!

The CSS and the layout of this sheet is an amalgamation of the work done by myself and ([@Actoba](https://app.roll20.net/users/427494/actoba) on roll20) on the 5e D&D sheet.
