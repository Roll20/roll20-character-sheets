# DCC Tabbed Character Sheet

This is a DCC sheet that uses tabs and Roll Templates.  It also includes a 0-level sheet, and a Monster sheet.  It is the same style sheet as the Mutant Crawl Classics (MCC) sheet.

### Credit Where Credit is Due
The CSS and the layout of this sheet is an amalgamation of the work done by myself and ([@Actoba](https://app.roll20.net/users/427494/actoba) on roll20) on the 5e D&D sheet.
