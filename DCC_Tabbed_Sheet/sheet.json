  "instructions": "# Dungeon Crawl Classics (DCC) Tabbed Character Sheet\r This sheet has a pared down 0-level Player sheet, a Level 1+ Player sheet and a Monster Sheet for the GM that are switchable via a tab at the top left of the sheet.\r\r* If you are currently using the original DCC sheet, it is recommended to make a copy of the campaign before switching to the new sheet.  The same variables were used whenever possible, but repeating sections data will not transfer at this time (I hope to add this feature).\r\r## Player Sheets\r\r* Most rolls should have Roll Templates.\r* Includes Core, Crawl and Crawling Under a Broken Moon classes.\r* For Thieves, you can use the old Beta % based rolls (per Claytonian JP's request)\r* Lucky rolls are included within rolls automatically whenever possible.\r* Roll Template Backgrounds based on the kind of rolls you are making.\r* Criticals and Fumbles are rolled automatically based on the d20 roll.\r\r## Monster Sheet\r\r* Monster Rolls have Roll Templates.\r* Certain rolls only go to GM\r* Melee and Ranged Attacks include Special attack ability\r* Criticals and Fumbles are rolled automatically based on the d20 roll.\r\r## Discord\r We have a discord server for using DCC RPG on Roll20. [Join us on Discord!](https://discord.gg/eGtnAGqGzj) Joining will help motivate us to continue working on the sheet :)\r\r## Bug Reports/Feature Requests\rBug reports and feature requests are welcome. For best results send an email to rgould@u2622.ca, or join our discord server. Contributions are always welcome!\r## Known Issues\r* Two characters with same name not supported as wrong attributes are used. (Roll20 issue, reported on 2021-01-08.
