  "instructions": "Designed for the role playing game Coriolis by Free League Publishing\n Updated Oct 26th 2020\n \n Inspired by Nic B's Tales from the Loop sheet. This sheet brings a lot of quality of life features to your roll20 Coriolis game, above all a fully functioning prayer that doesn't rely on an API subscription. \r\r## Features\r\r* Working prayer mechanic. All skills-checks comes with a button to re-roll dice not showing a 6\r* Roll templates for attribute checks, skill checks, weapon checks (including a target feature that quickly lets you roll for target armor\r* Roll templates for initiative, radiation and armor checks (with built in cover bonus)\r* Fully automated ship combat - built in orders and actions, EP management and Sensors.\r* Improved ship sheet with auto calculations (modules, energy points, cargo) and crew management.\r* Now with character notes!\r* This sheet is almost 90% compatible with the Coriolis sheet built in 2017. Attributes not visible in this sheet is **weapon attributes**, **gear attributes** and **bio/description**. The data from these old attributes should still be visible in the 'attributes and abilities' tab.\r\r## Known bugs\r\r* Please avoid using command characters like ( ) { } [ ] , '  ! @ # % & in your character name, as such characters have a tendency to break macros\n\n I really hope that you and your group will enjoy this sheet - may the icons always shine in your favour!",
