Terminator RPG roll20 sheet
The huge amout of work on this was initially created by seregrauko and taken from https://github.com/roll20/roll20-character-sheets/tree/master/SLA%20Industries%202ed
a shamelss amout of copy and paste and reformatting and changing words and terms to get this sheet.

## A couple of notes
When you select a role it will populate numerous fields. If you have addaitional skills to select they will show in a box underneath name and species.
Then you need to spend points as you require and all should aut-update...

The Jope section may not be quite right, but it should hopefully give indication of where to spend hope points - if not refere to rulebook.

I have updated weapons and armour  -though 2nd armour seems to break stuff - will update once I have played it.

I have added 3 user defined skills  - they won't show the actual total bonus, I couldn't get the integer to calc from the select.  However the dice roll will be correct.

I have no idea about rof and all thaem stats in the tables created on original char sheet.  I will go through this once I have played the game and have a better understanding of the combat mechanic.
