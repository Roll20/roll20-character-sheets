# Pathfinder (Cazra)

This Pathfinder character sheet is designed to provide a much simpler but
still very versatile alternative to the official Roll20 Pathfinder sheet.

The sheet features tabs, auto-calculated fields, rollable stats with
notes, and more. The focus of this sheet is to have an intuitive, easily
navigable interface while still being flexible enough to handle as much or as
little detail as you like about your character.

Please enjoy!
