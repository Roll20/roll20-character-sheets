On turns where the wielder acts, but does not use attacks, the wielder inflicts a -3 accuracy penalty on monsters targeting them.", "The weapon imbues the wielder with a sense of caffeinated quickness. When drawn for the first time, roll a 1d4. For the same number of turns that is rolled, the wielder may take two different actions (attacking two different monsters counts as two different actions). After that number of turns is up, the wielder has a caffeine crash, and cannot act for the rest of the battle.", "The weapon has a calming influence on all who see it.
