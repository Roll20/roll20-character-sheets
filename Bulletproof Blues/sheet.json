   "instructions": "# Bulletproof Blues Character Sheet\r## Attributes & Skill Rolls\rThe seven Core Attributes are:\r\r* **Brawn**\r* **Agility**\r* **Reason**\r* **Perception**\r* **Willpower**\r* **Prowess**\r* **Accuracy**\r\rEach of those labels is also a roll button that will output 2d6 + Attribute + Modifiers.\r\rIt is anticipated that those seven roll buttons will be used for any standard Attribute and/or skill roll.\r## Powers\rThis section is a repeating section so you can add as many powers as necessary. The first row contains a field for the power name, and a number field to the right to indicate the rank. The second row of each power is a free-form text field to note any special information pertaining to the power.\r## Weapons\rThis is a repeating section with fields to document the weapon, damage type (Strike, Blast, etc), type of weapon (Ranged or Melee), and Damage rating. Additionally, below each weapon is a free-form text field to capture any special notes about the weapon.\r\rEach weapon also contains a roll button for rolling attack and damage.\r## A Note on Rolls\rAll rolls will automatically prompt the user to enter any modifiers applicable to the roll.\r\rttribute and Weapon (Attack portion, anyway) rolls automatically include the value for the relevant Attribute, so when the modifiers prompt is displayed, the player should only enter anything additional (and it will be added to the final output). The same is true for the Damage multiplier on Weapons.\r## Special Thanks\rA special thanks goes to **Gareth**, for his help in understanding how the rolls in Bulletproof Blues work, and for giving solid direction on what was needed for the sheet."
