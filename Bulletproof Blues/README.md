Bulletproof Blues Character Sheet
=================================

This character sheet is designed to mirror (as closely as possible) the character sheet design from Bulletproof Blues Characte Sheet Helper.

Roll Buttons: Brawn, Agility, Reason, Perception, Willpower, Prowess, and Accuracy, are all roll buttons. Merely click the word to roll the dice. It is anticipated that those roll buttons would be used for skill rolls. In addition, each weapon has it's own roll button for rolling attack and damage.
