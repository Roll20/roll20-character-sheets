  "instructions": "A character and city sheet designed for the Dresden Files Role-Playing Game. Designed to match the pen-and-paper sheets as much as possible by default, with toggleable options to expand/reorganize some fields for easier online play.\n\n\nIncludes two roll templates: descriptiveroll and simpleroll. For the header, the templates accept a 'name' value for the character name, an optional 'verb' value that comes after the name (for example, 'Steve rolls...'), and a 'check' value that is the title of the roll (typically, the skill rolled). Then, both templates accept a descriptiveroll value which converts a roll into its equivalent on the Fate ladder, and a (technically optional) descriptivename value will display as the key. For example, '{{descriptivename=Discipline}} {{descriptiveroll=[[4]]}}' would display 'Discipline | Great (+4)'. It also supports descriptiveroll2 and 3 (along with descriptivename2 and 3) should you want multiple named roll results in one template roll.\n\nThe descriptiveroll template is functionally identical to the simpleroll template, except that it also accepts a 'roll' value, which it converts to its equivalent on the Fate ladder, and displays large and centered.\n\n\nThis sheet uses the same attribute names as the DFRPG sheet by Brian Shields, so the two sheets are mostly compatible if you want to switch between them. The only major incompatibility is the skill list, which functions completely differently here.",
