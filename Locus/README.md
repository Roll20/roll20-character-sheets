This was written by Steph Williamson for Cobblepath Games Ltd, but is free for use by anyone for any reason.

## Tabs
The first tab contains basic character information such as name, Haunt, Virtue.  It also contains macros which will roll the Outcome Checks, input your Attribute values into the fields. When rolling use the Easy, Medium or Hard buttons next to the Attribute you need to generate outcomes against. 

The second tab contains values for Willpower and Skills.

The third tab contains checkboxes for Health / Death's Door tracking, and Injuries.  

The final tab has room for character Inventories (both passive and active items) and Notes. 

## Card Decks
It is possible to play with a deck of cards within the Roll20 app.  This will have to be done using the macros tab of Roll20.  A guide to this can be found here https://wiki.roll20.net/Cards.  You will need to remove jokers.

We recommend the following settings:
- Show deck to players 
- Players can draw cards
- Cards are not infinite
- Disable choosing specific cards from deck
- Disable discard pile
- Play cards face down
- Considered Drawings when played (no bubbles/stats)
- Players & GMs can both see number of cards in other hands
- GMs can also see Fronts of cards

Otherwise, operation and use of this feature will work the same as it would around a table.  Players should manually draw and discard cards as appropriate.
