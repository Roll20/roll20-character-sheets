It includes option for the Mutant, Robot, Animal and Human campaigns. The sheet was based on the Forbidden Lands Community Sheet and Re-Written for MYZ hence the (RW) in the name. Thanks for the Forbidden Lands sheet, Vince!\n\nMany attributes on the sheet are auto-calculated and the sheet includes a built-in Dice Pool and roll template. Thank you Wes! \n\n Many areas of the sheet are expandable and will reveal more information by clicking on the small gear icon located in the upper left-hand corner of the row. \n\n **Dice Pool** \n Using the dice pool is normally a 2-step process; \n 1. click an action button e.g. Skill, Weapon, etc. which automatically selects the correct number of Attribute, Skill, and Gear dice to roll. Adjust the dice pool if desired. \n 2. press the 'Roll' button to roll the total dice selected. \n Dice can be selected and rolled directly from the dice pool as well. Pushing a roll from the dice pool requires manually de-selecting the appropriate number of dice from the pool before rolling. \n\n **API Dice** (optional) \n Pro subscribers may choose to use an API dice roller instead. The 'Mutant Year Zero' script must be installed to use the API-based roller, which requires the GM to hold a Pro account.  Install the script using the one-click installer found on the campaign page's API Scripts page. Toggle the 'API Dice' button located on the sheet's dice roller and all rolls from the sheet's roller will be passed to the API script for processing/output. \n\n",
