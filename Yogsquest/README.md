## _Yogsquest_ Character Sheet

Character sheet for _Yogsquest_ by Yogscast.

### NOTE

This character sheet relies on an external font, Badaboom. Roll20 has issues loading external fonts, as it tries to load them over an insecure connection despite being a secure page. Many browsers take issue with this, and block the content.

Most browsers should be able to override this function in some way, allowing this character sheet to render correctly. The process will likely be something like this (Chrome screenshot):

### Sheet updates

This sheet was created on request by a user unfamiliar with the game system. No further updates to this sheet are intended by the original author, but other authors are welcome to make fixes and improvements.
