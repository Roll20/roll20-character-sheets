    "rouage_info": "When you find yourself confronted with a mechanical system and you use this power, you automatically understand it. You understand its mode of operation and its use. However, this does not imply that you know how to use it completely immediately, any new activity requires training, but you know what to do to try.",
    "bouclier_ecto_info1": "Your perispirit spreads around the body like invisible but tangible armor.",
    "bouclier_ecto_info2": "Projectiles are automatically stopped by the shield, only melee attacks can hope to pass through it. To find out if your shield resists your opponent, you must measure your will (action in opposition COURAGE + ROUA'H against ROUA'H). The shield remains active for three turns.",
    "coupe_deux_info": "You are able to sever a human body, including your own, in two, by the waist or even by decapitating it. Both parts of the body continue to function and the severed individual remains conscious, suffering neither pain or damage. You can re-weld the two body parts whenever you want.",
    "cri_banshee_info1": "Your scream brings a target to the verge of fainting. The sound produced by the scream is likely to freeze the blood. The victim who suffers it is shaken by a terrible pain hitting his eardrums as well as a extreme and sudden feeling of fatigue.",
    "cri_banshee_info2": "You must succeed in an action using AUTHORITY + NEFESH (+POWER) against the target's NEFESH (+STURDY). If your roll is successful, the hit points of each part of his body pass beyond the black circle. The GM then chooses whether the NPC remains conscious or not. In all cases, it is weakened.",
    "cri_banshee_info3": "Any member already injured beyond the black circle is not affected. In the event of failure, you only cause the target to lose two circles of health, chosen by the GM if there are any before the black circles.",
    "cri_banshee_info4": "The Spirit converts a portion of the circles of health lost by the victim into points of perispirit: the scale is 1 point gained for 2 circles extorted. If you exceed the number of perispirit points delimited by your gauges, you can distribute additional perispirit points as you see fit to other Spirits.",
    "dans_pierre_info1": "You are able to insert one object into another, permanently. You decide the conditions allowing the two elements to be separated. An individual with the same power can achieve this without needing to follow them.",

    "dans_pierre_info3": "The body must be in contact with both objects.",
    "evasion_info": "You easily escape from restraints, whether a straitjacket, handcuffs, tightly tied rope or heavy chains.",
    "force_invisible_info1": "You use your perispirit to attack an individual or several individuals at a distance. The number of simultaneous attacks depends on the number of perispirit you spend. The \"invisible force\" can strike at any distance from the moment your targets are within sight.",
    "force_invisible_info2": "The damage from an attack is 3 points + ROUA'H, must be randomly located and can be absorbed.",
    "force_invisible_info3": "You must spend 3 perispirit points by simultaneous attack.",
    "griffe_tenebre_info1": "You can shape the body in such a way as to generate a weapon. It can be a claw, a fist as hard as stone, etc. This new appendage is used during a confrontation with melee.",
    "griffe_tenebre_info2": "The damage is 1D to which we add the number of perispirit points spent and the POWER attribute.",
    "intangibilite_info1": "You can cross solid surfaces. While crossing the surface, the body can no longer breathe, which limits the use of this power to thick walls or floors.",
    "intangibilite_info2": "The power ends once the surface has been crossed.",
    "lecteur_vie_info": "You can have, when you use this power, a short summary of the lives of the people you meet provided that you succeed in a roll in opposition with ATTENTION + ROUA'H against NESHAMA. For each perispirit point that you spend (up to 3), you obtain useful information, at the discretion of the game leader. If you fail the dice, your perispirit points are returned to you.",
    "levitation_info": "You manage to raise the body above the ground through the use of your will. It levitates to a height equal to twice its size. You can spend one perispirit point every five minutes to maintain your levitation.",
    "telepathie_info": "You can communicate without the use of speech or hearing. During the duration of telepathic communication, each sentence you say costs 1 perispirit point.",
    "ubiquite_info": "As you continue to occupy the Cabinet as a Whisper, you split yourself. This double of yourself then leaves the body of the medium and can move away from it as you wish for the duration of a scene, that he will live on his own and that you will play separately. This second incarnation is immaterial but visible and has your features, during your lifetime. In this form, you can speak out loud, and move in the manner of a normal human being, with the difference that you cross all types of surfaces and you cannot grasp anything. Your consciousness is split and inhabits both your Cabinet form and the exterior double.",
