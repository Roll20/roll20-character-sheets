	"instructions": "# Hunter: The Reckoning Character Sheet\r For use in the classic World of Darkness.  Designed to function much like an actual paper sheet would.  With the most notable exception being that you can roll Willpower directy from the sheet.  Also, The Dice Pool section in the center at the bottom allow one to select an Attribute and/or Ability to roll; The Other Traits may also be seleceted in the Ability drop down.  The check to the left of each die pool selection indicates that the roll has a specialty (i.e. dice will explode)  All rolls from the sheet are of the from {Xd10}>Df1 or {Xd10!}>Df1 if special, where X is the number of dice and D is the difficulty.  NOTE: These roll do not recognize botches. Further, the rolls will prompt the user to modify the number of dice rolled and set the difficulty.  The defaults for these are 0 and 6 respectively. In the 'Edges', you put in the textbox, the name, creed and trigger of each edge, and in Virtues you just enter the number of dots you have in 'Score', and the amount you spent in 'Spent'."
