- Parsed rolls: changed feat die rolls from 1d12-1 to 1d12. Implemented correct handling of (11,12) values for pc and lm rolls and for favoured and ill-favoured rolls

- currentendurace -> endurance
- hope -> hope_max
- currenthope -> hope

## 02.05.00 (Build 8)

### Sheet fixes

- Parsed rolls: fixed Eye of Sauron fails roll even if not miserable and roll >= TN
- Added missing sheet translation support (missing rolltemplate translation will follow in a later release)

### CSS fixes

- Removed 1d12-1 display for the feat die, because this was not easy to understand for players

## 02.04.00 (Build 7)

### New Features

- adversary sheet and rolls include weary modifier
- new roll-template to denote non-roll messages. Format &{template:msg} {{header=Generic Header}} {{sub1=Subheadline1}} {{sub2=Subheadline2}} {{msg=This is a test}}

### CSS

- import fonts from fonts.google
- update to higher resolution borders

## 02.02.01 (Build 7)

### CSS fixes

- added two missing .charsheet prefixes in the pc css
- fixed a typo in the roll-template css

## 02.02.00 (Build 6)

- The macro bar is now available for parsed rolls (which is not easy to achieve as parsed roll buttons are action buttons and need special treatment to be available for the macro bar). You can drag / drop attack and protection rolls from the sheet into the macro bar and click those actions directly without opening the sheet. This is especially useful in conjunction with targeted attacks and will smooth and speed up battles.

### Bugfixes

- bugfix miserable
- bugfix favourill not initialized
- css cleanup
- fixing two issues that might have had an impact on the roll-template issue! (fingers crossed)

## 02.01.00 (Build 5)

### Features

- changed stance values from "Forward/Open/Defensive/Rearward" to "1/2/3/4" because this opens the way for players to easily toggle stance by using the token bar
- stance changes toggle the stance attack bonus automatically (forward:1/open:0/defensive:-1/rearward:0). The checkbox now only effects the attack damage bonus and is automatically activated when in forward stance (this can be used for Beorning with GREAT STRENGTH virtue to get +1 damage bonus in forward stance).
- adversary targeted attack will take the opponent's stance into account and modify the success dice with +1/0/-1 automatically.
- favoured protection rolls (e.g. due to dwarf virtue "stone hard")

### Bugfixes

- CM checkbox not clickable (armour with cunning make), <https://trello.com/c/lM1rrRA9>
- swapped position of Valour and Wisdom

## 02.00.01 (Build 4)

- rename Advancement Points -> Adventure Points

## 02.00.00 (Build 3)

- integrate roll parsing to get rid of custom roll tables.
- integration of armour qualities in the layout (cunning make and close fitting)
- favoured/ill-favoured rolls for adversaries
- integrate roll-templates
- numerous layout optimizations and UI improvments

## 01.01.00 (Build 2)

- added sheet worker to set the skill rolls on every update of the favoured skill state or global favoured state. This replaces the static switches in the rolls that were hard to read for players.
