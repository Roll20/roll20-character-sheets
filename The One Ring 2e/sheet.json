  "instructions": "The One Ring 2nd Edition. This is a rewrite based on the early 2e (basic) and 1e edition that also includes a 2e version for adversaries. It features correct handling of favoured rolls and stance related bonus changes to attack rating, parry, protection and damage. In addition to the classic custom roll tables the sheet also includes roll-templates for parsed rolls (player can toggle). \r\r**Important:** For table rolls to work properly, follow the instructions on [The One Ring wiki page](https://wiki.roll20.net/The_One_Ring#Rollable_Tables) to set up custom rollable tables for your game. If you want to use parsed rolls you don't have to do this anymore. \rMore info: [Readme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Roll20/roll20-character-sheets/master/The%20One%20Ring%202e/readme.md) and [wiki page](https://wiki.roll20.net/The_One_Ring).
