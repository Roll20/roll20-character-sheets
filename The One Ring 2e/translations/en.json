A high <span class='sheet-strong'>Persuade</span> score denotes an uncommon eloquence, a love of speech and knowledge of its proper use and its effect on listeners. Wise men, advisors to chieftains and kings and their messengers all share this passion for the spoken word.<br><br>The successful use of the skill lets the hero convince his audience of the flaws in their current position. A great success convinces the subject of the quality of the hero’s stance, while an extraordinary success may turn the subject into an ardent believer.",

The skill includes hiding, moving quietly and shadowing others.

Hunters, burglars, and solitary fighters use <span class='sheet-strong'>Stealth</span> to prosper in their trade.<br><br>A successful <span class='sheet-strong'>Stealth</span> roll indicates that the character has gone unnoticed, while a failure has almost certainly attracts unwanted attention.<br><br>A great or extraordinary success produces an outcome so flawless that it even be impossible to trace the hero’s actions after the fact.",

A successful <span class='sheet-strong'>Search</span> roll generally lets the characters find what they are looking for if it is to be found. A great or extraordinary success usually means the object is found more quickly. If an item is particularly well hidden, the Loremaster could decide that a higher level of success is required to uncover it.",

This skill is also used to gain helpful insight from a spoken or written riddle.",
