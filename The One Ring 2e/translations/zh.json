A characteristic with deeply personal implications, a hero’s rank in Wisdom also determines the stature of the hero in the eyes of those that prize these qualities.<br><br>When Wisdom is chosen over Valour when spending Experience points, it suggests that the hero’s adventures are affecting him subtly but profoundly.

A high <span class='sheet-strong'>Persuade</span> score denotes an uncommon eloquence, a love of speech and knowledge of its proper use and its effect on listeners. Wise men, advisors to chieftains and kings and their messengers all share this passion for the spoken word.<br><br>The successful use of the skill lets the hero convince his audience of the flaws in their current position. A great success convinces the subject of the quality of the hero’s stance, while an extraordinary success may turn the subject into an ardent believer.",

The skill includes hiding, moving quietly and shadowing others. These activities often rely on quickness and precision, so a stealthy hero combines practiced caution with the ability to judge the right moment to take a chance. Hunters, burglars, and solitary fighters use <span class='sheet-strong'>Stealth</span> to prosper in their trade.<br><br>A successful <span class='sheet-strong'>Stealth</span> roll indicates that the character has gone unnoticed, while a failure has almost certainly attracts unwanted attention.<br><br>A great or extraordinary success produces an outcome so flawless that it even be impossible to trace the hero’s actions after the fact.",

Heroes with <span class='sheet-strong'>Insight</span> can recognise when someone is lying, and can draw useful conclusions about people’s motives. A hero with a high <span class='sheet-strong'>Insight</span> score is often recognised as being a sensible and discerning individual, and many might seek his counsel. A successful <span class='sheet-strong'>Insight</span> roll provides the hero with a faithful, if partial, portrait of the character observed. A great or extraordinary success reveals truths about an individual of which he himself is ignorant. <span class='sheet-strong'>Insight</span> tests may be rolled in opposition to an adversary using <span class='sheet-strong'>Persuade</span> or another Personality skill.",

This skill may let a hero search a library to locate a piece of relevant information, look for concealed doors or hidden inscriptions, recognise a familiar face in a crowd or even search a suspected thief’s clothing. One roll is required for each inspection of a small area, such as a room. <span class='sheet-strong'>Search</span> rolls are generally initiated by the player rather than the Loremaster; <span class='sheet-strong'>Awareness</span> is used to see if the characters passively notice something. A successful <span class='sheet-strong'>Search</span> roll generally lets the characters find what they are looking for if it is to be found. A great or extraordinary success usually means the object is found more quickly. If an item is particularly well hidden, the Loremaster could decide that a higher level of success is required to uncover it.",
	"perception-description": "The ability to catch hidden details often pays off, be it noticing an odd noise that gives away an ambusher, catching the gleam in the eyes of a liar or spotting the crack in the wall that reveals a secret door.",

This skill is also used to gain helpful insight from a spoken or written riddle.",

Whenever an action involves knowledge of some kind, a <span class='sheet-strong'>Lore</span> roll is required.
