# Earthdawn-4E
Character sheet for playing Earthdawn 4th Edition on Roll20

DISCLAIMER: This is NOT a Character Builder.  It does very little math for you.

You will need a Pro account in order to use this Custom Character Sheet.

This is written to work with the following API scripts:
- ChatSetAttr version 1.3 (https://github.com/joesinghaus/roll20-api-scripts/blob/master/ChatSetAttr/ChatSetAttr.js)
- Power Cards 3.4.4 (https://gist.github.com/Sky-Captain-13/452330a3d926b32da49c)

Power Cards will require you to create a Handout named "PowerCard Formats" that is visible to all Players with the following information:
* blue: --bgcolor|#1d5dc4 --txcolor|#FFFFFF --titlefontshadow|none
* gold: --bgcolor|#e58900 --txcolor|#FFFFFF--titlefontshadow|none
* green: --bgcolor|#008000 --txcolor|#FFFFFF --titlefontshadow|none
* grey: --bgcolor|#444444 --txcolor|#FFFFFF--titlefontshadow|none
* red: --bgcolor|#d60606 --txcolor|#FFFFFF --titlefontshadow|none

You can change the color numbers (#XXXXXX) if you like, but do not change the names (blue, green, etc).

When you set up a Token, I recommend setting the bars to track "Wounds," "Karma," and "Uncon" (Damage).
