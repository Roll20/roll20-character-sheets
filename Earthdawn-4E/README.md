# Earthdawn-4E
Character sheet for playing Earthdawn 4th Edition on Roll20

DISCLAIMER: This is NOT a Character Builder.  It does very little math for you.

You will need a Pro account in order to use the rolls on this Character Sheet.
They are written to work with the following API scripts:
- ChatSetAttr version 1.6 (Available on the API Script Library)
- Power Cards 3.5.0 (https://gist.github.com/Sky-Captain-13/452330a3d926b32da49c)

When you make a new Character, tab through all the entry boxes to create the attributes on the Attributes and Abilities Tab.
When you set up a Token, I recommend setting the bars to track "Wounds," "Karma," and "Uncon" (Damage).

Power Cards will require you to create a Handout named "PowerCard Formats" that is visible to all Players with the following information.  You can change the color numbers (#XXXXXX) if you like, but do not change the names (blue, green, etc).

gold: --bgcolor|#e58900 --txcolor|#FFFFFF--titlefontshadow|none
