# Elric! / Stormbringer Character Sheet as this it uses a  different system than Stormbringer 1st - 4th edition.  It may also be suitable for Magic World if you ignore the graphics.

One thing to note is the way the damage works.  Instead of just knocking  points down as damage is taken there is a damage box so you can put in wounds as they are taken so that you can apply first aid separately.  So if you take a 2pt wound and then a 4 point wound the damage box  should look like 2+4. As first aid is applied  you can total the healed wounds. So in the previous example if the 3 point wound recieved 2 points of Physik  and the 4 point wound also recived 2 points of Physik record the remaining damage as 0+3 so you can keep track of wounds that have already recieved Physik. Make sure there is no trailing + signs, so don't have it look like 3+5+ .
