# Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 2e Character Sheet
version 0.1

This work is based on original efforts by a Shawn Newsome.

The sheet has been revamped and a number of immediate errors addressed.

The original use of Honey Badger's PowerCards v1 has been removed, however, a feature is being planned to reintegrate v2 into the sheet (the current version, v2.3.5, replaces the older version in this repos).

## API Script Included

If you are a player, you enjoy the benefits of your GM's Mentor account. If your GM does not have a Mentor account, consider gifting him/her one.

The supporting API Scripts include:
1. IsGM and IsGMModule
2. Ammo
3. TurnMarker1

These scripts, by Aaron C. Meadows, augment the Roll20 experience is specific ways and have been integrated into the Character Sheet. Ammo increments missile and gunpowder ammo on the character sheet. This can also increment NPC ammo on the turn tracker. This adds a level of verisimilitude to the game that may not be desired.

Use of the scripts is optional.

### Installing API scripts
As a Mentor, do the following:
1. From the My Campaigns, select View Details.
2. From the View Details page, select API Scripts
3. For each script provided by this character sheet, copy and paste the contents into a New Script window.

## Future features
1. Roll Templates
2. NPC Short Sheet/Tab
3. Roll Widgets
4. Combat and Spell API scripts
5. More documentation for player macros
