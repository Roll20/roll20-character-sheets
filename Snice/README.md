## List of Custom Values
To modify certain aspects of a character sheet that are auto calculated, there are certain hidden attribute values a GM can use to modify these by adding them to the Attributes / Abilities tab of a Roll20 character and using positive or negative numbers.

* Life_Points_Bonus = Adds on top of the calculated maximum Life_Points value.
* Attribute_Points_Bonus = Adds to the Total_Points value, the calculated remaining Attribute Points.
* Skill_Points_Bonus = Adds to the remaining Skill_Points value

## Additional Features
The Snice Roll20 Character Sheet contains a radio button option at the bottom to switch a specific character sheet between Player & NPC mode.
In NPC mode, all sheet controlled rolls, except for attack checks, are sent to the GM.

The sheet features a Skills / Abilities section in the design of the official Snice Skill Sheets, where Game Masters or players themselves can add their obtained skills, shortcuts for item action rolls, etc. The Point Cost field automatically decreases the remaining Skill Points if used to keep track of it.

Below the Skills / Abilities section, a basic Inventory section can be found where players can add a name, description and count of an item or use it to take notes.
