They provide mechanical and narrative advantages, but also reflect who you are and how you interact with the world. When you create your character in the next chapter, you'll select at least two paths to get started.\n\nSome paths represent your skill with a signature weapon style or piece of equipment. If you see a requirement at the top of the asset card, such as “If you wield a bladed weapon…,” the asset is only usable when taking action using that item.",
