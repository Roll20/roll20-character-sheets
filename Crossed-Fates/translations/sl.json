  "act_zero_subtitle": "A conflict swallowed the world.",
  "act_zero_prompt": "The world is defined by its Conflict - something that happened a long time ago, is currently happening, or shall happen when the time is right. The Conflict is unstoppable and unavoidable, and everyone must choose a side.",
  "act_zero_journal": "You have once found a letter detailing how your Side of the Conflict perceives it. Who wrote the letter, and why? What do they say about the Conflict and the people involved in it? What did they hope that letter would accomplish? Write the letter you’ve found. Once you’re done - or if you choose to write the letter later by yourself - move on to the next act.",

  "act_one_prompt": "Maybe you didn’t know it back then and never asked for it, but Fate willed you to be your Side’s hero, the only hope of achieving victory and putting the Conflict to an end. Yours is the burden, to lead and to make impossible choices. Flesh out your characters by yourselves.",
  "act_one_journal": "You once sent a letter to someone you loved, detailing your own feelings about the Conflict and how you got involved in its madness. You shared your hopes and dreams - or maybe you didn’t share a thing, for feelings are too dangerous to someone in your position. Either way, write the letter you sent. Once you’re done - or if you choose to write the letter later by yourself - move on to the next act.",

  "act_two_prompt": "You hadn’t met them yet, but you had heard whispers about someone like you. Their Side also had a new face, someone in which they put all their hope. Every battle you attended, you wondered if maybe this was the time in which you’d finally meet the person you were destined to fight, the only other person who could possibly understand your fate.",
  "act_two_journal": "After the battle, you sent a letter to your Superior Officers, detailing your encounter with your Rival. Describe how you first perceived them. What was striking about their presence and the choices they made? How did they fight and behave in battle? Can you defeat them? Write the letter you sent. Once you’re done - or if you choose to write the letter later by yourself - move on to the next act.",
  "act_three": "ACT 3: BATTLE SCARS",
  "act_three_subtitle": "You were destined to lose.",
  "act_three_prompt": "The Conflict is ruthless, and to survive, you must be ruthless as well. You’ve fought on many battles, and your Sworn Rival has matched you each time. For every battle you won, you lost another. The Conflict ravages the entire world - but to you, it’s personal. Your Rival has taken too much. You still think about that which made your Destinies forever intertwined. The first time you truly hurt each other.",
  "act_three_journal": "You once wrote a letter about how your Rival hurt you, and about your promise to stop them. You wanted to keep it close so you’d never forget, but the truth is you could never forget even if you wanted to. Your scars will follow you on every battle. So you burned the letter, and its fire burns inside you. Hold on to that feeling. It fuels you. It always will. Seek your Rival.",

You both lost too much - and you both took too much from each other as well. The battles don’t stop coming and you fight relentlessly, hoping maybe this time your Rival will be there, and you’ll finally be able to put an end to the Conflict - or that you’ll finally be given the rest you’ve been longing for. Maybe this time…",
  "act_final_instruction_two": "You’ll engage on multiple battles until one of you finally falls. Every battle will take its toll, and it’s your duty to never forget what was lost. For too long, only those who won were allowed to tell their stories, but you’re here to make sure no loss is taken for granted. Fight to win - but if you lose, make them feel it.",
