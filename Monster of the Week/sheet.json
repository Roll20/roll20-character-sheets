If you still want to use this sheet, then:\n* Choose a Playbook from the dropdown menu to get started.\r* Along with the original 12 playbooks, there are 4 playbooks from the Tome of Mysteries supplement, 7 playbooks from the Reinforcements supplement, and 1 playbook exclusively released in the Brazilian edition and translated into English by Anistuffs.\r\r* Popup box is for roll modifiers like +1 forward, -1 ongoing, etc.  Enter numbers as 1 or -1, but not +1 (the + symbol breaks it).\r\r If you run into any issues, have suggestions, or anything else, PM on roll20; https://app.roll20.net/users/1609908/katie, https://app.roll20.net/users/1665985/anistuffs, or report it at http://github.com/LethalKitten/roll20-character-sheets, https://github.com/Anistuffs/roll20-character-sheets.",
