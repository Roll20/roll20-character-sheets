It is highly recommended to have the latest version of Chrome, Firefox or Edge for the best user experience.\r\rThere are two distinct sheet types that come bundled with this character sheet: the Character and the Monster sheet type. The user can toggle between these modes from the dropdown box at the top center of the sheet aptly labeled 'Sheet Type.'\r\r### Character Sheet Type\r\rThe Character sheet type is meant for player characters and non player characters that call for a more details-oriented approach to character management. This entails your typical Roll20 sheet features: a multi-tab interface, automated calculations, sheet rolling macros, repeating sections, etc.\r\r### Monster Sheet Type\r\rThe Monster sheet type is meant for monsters, to be used exclusively by the DM. It condenses everything down to one page (no tab interface), and removes autocalculations entirely in favor of giving more control to the DM with editing values. Utilizing this sheet type effectively will enable the DM to drag and drop monster tokens and keep track of their respective stats without having to wade through the tabular interface meant for more complex character types.\r\r### Bugs and Feedback\r\rReport bugs or suggestions to the projectâs [issue tracker](https://github.com/Azurift/roll20-character-sheets/issues)\r\r[Sheet Readme](https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-character-sheets/blob/master/FFD20/README.md).",
