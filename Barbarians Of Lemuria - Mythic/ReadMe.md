The sheet has some integrated rolls (with chat roll templates).  
Every roll asks for, at least, a modifier (default 0).  
  * Attributes. 3 roll buttons per Attribute: standard (2d6), with Bonus Die (3d6kh2) and with Penalty Die (3d6kl2). Checks against 9.
    * Agility: accounts for Armour and Shield penalty.
  * Combat Abilities. 3 roll buttons per Ability: standard (2d6), with Bonus Die (3d6kh2) and with Penalty Die (3d6kl2).
    * Initiative (Priority roll): accounts for Helmet penalty. Checks against 9.
    * Melee attack: asks for attribute choice (default is Agility, or Strength) and Target's defence. Checks against 9.
    * Ranged attack: asks for Range (with dropdown list) and Target's defence. Checks against 9.
  * Armour (Damage reduction): accounts for choosen Armour and worn Helmet.
  * Weapon damage: accounts for dice and Strength or Half-Strength bonus, as choosen in the dropdown list.

Due to some temporary technical translation limitations of Roll20, the french version asks for roll variable (range, modifier etc.) in english, for now.
