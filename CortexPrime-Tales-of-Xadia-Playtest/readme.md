Tales of Xadia: The Dragon Prince RPG - Playtest Character Sheet - Cortex Prime

##Set up

- Open the Journal tab, and add a new Character.
- Click on save changes.
- Now switch to the Character Sheet tab.
- There is a green Edit button to make changes to the sheet.
- Select the Character Portrait from the list - this will also select and fill out the distinction blocks.
- Select 'Custom Character' option if you are not using any of the pregen characters.
- Set the dice values for the Attributes, Values, and Specialities using the further drop downs.
- Enter the remaining details - Name, Description, Value statements, Asset details and (if needed) custom Distinctions in the editable text fields.
- Click the Edit button again to hide the editor.

- Repeat this for each of the remaining characters.

##Dice Pool Builder

The inbuilt Dice Pool Builder pulls from the character's attributes, rolls and displays the dice used and what they rolled. Hitches show up with black icons.

*NOTE* This dice roller does not support the 3D dice feature in Roll20. - Also it won't work with the Beta Mobile App.

##Stress and Trauma

These traits will only display on the character sheet as they are assigned to the character, in the same manner as the Specialities.

Any feedback, or requests - I'm happy to hear.
