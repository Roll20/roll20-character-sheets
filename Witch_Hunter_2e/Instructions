Welcome to the Witch Hunter: The Invisible World 2nd Edition Character Sheet!

Most of the content of the sheet is pretty basic.  However, there are a few details that require some explaination.

CHECKBOXES
Checkboxes generally turn on different conditions which can modify dice pools.
In the Skills section (Tab 2), checkboxes are used to denote background skills.  They have no other function.
In the Combat section (Tab 3), checkboxes are either used to note Specialization in a skill or weapon.  In the Conditions area, the checkboxes turn on different conditions that can modify various dice pools:
Surprised: applies a â€“2 penalty to Initiative
Exhausted: adds 1 point to the wounds attribute (this comes in handy for characters with the Nightmares flaw)
Vanquished: when the character's wound track is exhausted, he is vanquished.  This adds D1 to the Unconsciousness roll.
Shaken: adds -1d penalty to the Fear roll button.

THE TOP BAR
While most dice pools in Witch Hunter are formulaic, sometimes the GM will call for unorthodox dice pool combinations (ie. Resolve+Strength).  That's where the top bar comes in.  These let you create up to three "custom" dice pools.  The second and third are preset for Endurance+Toughness (Unconsciousness) and Resolve+Courage (Fear) but are easily modified.  Checking the checkbox denotes a specialization and reduces the success threshold from 7 to 6.

ORGANIZED PLAY
This section is included for partcipants in the Witch Hunter: Revelations campaign or subsequent living campaigns based on the Witch Hunter rules.  It is intended for record keeping only.
