<h1>Witch Hunter: The Invisible World (2nd edition)</h1>

<p><b>Character Sheet by Tom (blusponge)</b>
<p><i>Big Thanks to the helpful contributions of Brian, without whom this sheet wouldn't be nearly as functional.</i>

<h4>A Note on Checkboxes</h4>
Checkboxes are used throughout this sheet for a variety of purposes.  I have tried to label all their uses, but in case there is any confusionâ€¦

<i>Specialization (Custom Dice Pools, Combat, Hand-to-Hand and Ranged Weapons):</i> These checkboxes indicate that the roll is specialized and reduce the threshold of success from 7+ to 6+.

<i>Background Skills (Skills), Literacy (Language):</i> These checkboxes are for bookkeeping reference only.  They have no other function within the character sheet.

<i>Hidden Areas (Survivor Points, Flaw Details, Talent Details and Conditions):</i> These chackboxes hide and reveal this information, a lot of which will rarely need referencing in play.  Checking the checkboxes within these sections activate bonuses and penalties provided by these conditions and are handled in the background.

<h4>Organized Play</h4>
This section is provided for potential Witch Hunter: Revelations or other organized play events.  This allows the player and GM to reference information from previous ARs  and is for bookkeeping only.

<h4>Known Issues</h4>
For some reason, the tab bars are not visible in Firefox.  To date, no one has been able to figure out the cause of this issue.  I suspect some sort of CSS error or inconsistency.
