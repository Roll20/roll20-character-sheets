- const disorders={'addiction':'Your Agent relies on a harmful habit or substance to get by. However much harm the addiction causes, your Agent needs the relief it offers. Losing 2+ SAN in any single roll triggers an acute episode, an overwhelming need. Feeding it usually imparts a −20% penalty to stats and skills for a few hours due to intoxication or distraction. And even in the best of times, going 24 hours without feeding the addiction costs 1D6 WP and prevents your Agent from recovering any WP. Every further 24 hours costs 1D6 WP. At 2 or fewer WP, your Agent does irrational, self-destructive things to feed the addiction.','amnesia':'This is a common disorder from encounters with the unnatural. Losing 2+ SAN in any single roll triggers an acute episode, which erases all memory of the episode until your Agent finds a way to bring it back.','anxiety disorder': 'Your Agent is seized by worry, fatigue, restlessness, headaches, and savage panic attacks. Losing 2+ SAN in any single roll triggers an acute episode, in which all skill and stat tests and SAN rolls are at −20%.','conversion disorder': 'Choose one form of this disorder: blindness, deafness, or paralysis. Suffering temporary insanity or reaching the Breaking Point triggers an acute episode, which leaves your Agent blind, deaf, or paralyzed with numbness and tremors until the stress subsides.', 'depersonalization disorder': 'Losing 2+ SAN in any single roll triggers an acute episode in which your Agent suffers detachment, feeling helplessly disconnected from his or her own body, thoughts, and emotions. That numb detachment incurs a −20% penalty to every skill and stat test.','depression': 'Acute depression means total despair and a crushing inability to get anything done. It sometimes takes the shape of overwhelming guilt. An acute episode is triggered by reminders of past traumas your Agent suffered or inflicted, which can come in the most surprising forms and moments. During an acute episode, every skill or stat test costs 1D4 WP.', 'dissociative identity disorder': 'Most of the time, your Agent seems fine. Suffering temporary insanity or reaching the Breaking Point triggers an acute episode, in which your Agent takes on an alternate identity with its own personality and memories. Over time, more identities may surface. The Handler decides when and whether you keep control of your Agent’s behavior.', 'enclosed related phobia': 'Both agoraphobia (fear of open spaces) and claustrophobia (fear of enclosed spaces) are frequent reactions to helplessness. The first arises because the open area is too big to control, the second because the enclosure is too small to escape. Entering a distinctly open (or enclosed) space triggers an acute episode, during which all SAN tests are at a −20% penalty.', 'fugues': 'Suffering temporary insanity or reaching the Breaking Point causes your Agent to shut down into catatonia or wander off in an unconnected daze.','intermitted explosive disorder': 'Your Agent suffers from episodes of sudden, uncontrollable fury. Losing 2+ SAN in any single roll triggers an acute episode, in which your Agent explodes with irrational rage. Every outburst is out of proportion to whatever real or perceived threat provoked it. The heart races, the body sweats, the head fills with rage, and nothing is safe. Sometimes attacking whatever is in front of your Agent is a relief from his or her inner turmoil.', 'ligyrophobia': 'Fear of loud noises. In modern conflicts, the roar of artillery, the rumble of armored vehicles, and the deafening din of explosions and gunshots are intense stimuli that provoke a phobic reaction. But loud noises even in everyday life can trigger the panic and overwhelming stress of an acute episode. In an acute episode, every SAN is at a a −20% penalty. This used to be called shell shock.', 'megalomania': 'What does it mean to look upon the face of a dead god and live? Some see themselves as messiahs, or as exempt from ordinary morality. Losing 2+ SAN in any single roll triggers an acute episode, in which every hint of doubt about your Agent’s superiority fills him or her with indignation. That causes every use of a stat or skill to get help or make a good impression to fail.','obsession': 'Your Agent becomes fixated on some person, place, event, act, or idea. Losing 2+ SAN in any single roll triggers an acute episode, which lasts days. In that time, any long-term action or skill use—anything taking more than a few hours—is at −20% because your Agent’s mind is so often wrapped around its obsession','obsessive/compulsive disorder': 'If the only thing you can control in prison is the arrangement of belongings on a windowsill, you are likely to become very focused on them. An Agent with obsessive-compulsive disorder suffers a constant need to arrange everything perfectly. Losing 2+ SAN in any single roll triggers an acute episode. That incurs a −20% penalty to every skill test, stat test, and SAN roll until your Agent brings things into order.','paranoia': 'A state of extreme suspicion, in which a fear of invisible enemies pervades one’s world-view. Losing 2+ SAN in any single roll triggers an acute episode. Unless your Agent finds a way to stifle his or her paranoia, he or she can’t trust or rely on anyone. Every event, every disagreement or source of suspicion is a clue to a conspiracy against the Agent. ', 'ptsd': 'Post-traumatic sress disorder is a psychiatric disorder that occurs following life-threatening events. A victim of PTSD relives the experience in nightmares and flashbacks, has difficulty sleeping, is subject to depression, and can be overcome by anxiety in similar situations. An acute episode is triggered by reminders of past traumas your Agent suffered or inflicted. In an acute episode, the Handler chooses one effect: your Agent either reacts violently to threats only the Agent perceives, or suffers an acute depressive episode','sleep disorder': 'Every time your Agent tries to sleep, make a SAN test. If it fails, your Agent wakes repeatedly in terror and cannot rest or regain any Willpower Points for 24 hours.', 'totemic compulsion': 'Your Agent fixates on an object present during the trauma and credits it with his or her “salvation.” This is often a weapon or a piece of protective gear. Losing the item or just thinking it’s lost, giving it to someone else, letting it be taken or destroyed, or going without it for more than an hour all trigger acute episodes. Your Agent suffers a −10% penalty to every skill test, stat test, and SAN roll until he or she recovers the totem or the Handler decides the Agent has fixated on a new one.'};
- const defensiveQualities={'trascendent': 'Transcendent entities are entirely immune to physical damage. This might mean they exist partly in dimensions we barely perceive, or are organized such that mere excesses of physical force do them no harm. Nothing of this Earth is transcendent. Only through the use of unnatural techniques, under extremely dangerous and limited situations, can humans become transcendent. Some entities’ transcendence protects only against certain kinds of harm. The Handler makes the final call as to what this defense does or does not cover. Unless the entity’s description says otherwise, hypergeometry inflicts full damage upon it.','out_of_phase': 'Some entities weave in and out of our physical space from moment to moment. A damage or lethality roll with an even number inflicts damage as usual. A roll with an odd number passes harmlessly through, inflicting no damage. Unless the entity’s description says otherwise, hypergeometry always inflicts full damage upon it.','uncanny_matter' : 'Entities of this type are made of non-terrene matter or are from alternate, more punishing dimensions, making them all but immune to physical harm. lethality rolls against a creature of uncanny matter always fail, and the creature takes no more than one HP of damage from any attack. Some entities have this defense only against certain kinds of harm. Unless the entity’s description says otherwise, hypergeometry inflicts full damage upon it.','persistent' : 'An entity of this type is imbued with unnatural vitality. A successful lethality roll destroys it, but it takes only half HP damage from attacks (including failed lethality rolls). Some entities are persistent only against certain kinds of harm. Unless the entity’s description says otherwise, hypergeometry inflicts full damage upon it.','resilient': 'Due to size or unnatural toughness, an entity of this type can withstand overwhelming force. A successful lethality roll does not destroy a resilient entity, but inflicts HP damage equal to the lethality_percent rating.','huge': 'No lethality roll is required against a huge target; it simply takes HP damage equal to the lethality_percent rating, whether the roll succeeds or fails. A creature need not be unnatural to be huge. A rhino, blue whale, or elephant would be a huge target.','unnatural_biology': 'Some entities’ bodies are arranged so strangely that an Agent can’t tell what parts may be most vulnerable. It’s not possible to attempt a called shot to increase damage, an option described in the Agent’s Handbook. Attacks otherwise have the usual effects.','armor': 'Reduce the HP damage by the listed Armor amount. A successful lethality roll destroys the entity.',};
