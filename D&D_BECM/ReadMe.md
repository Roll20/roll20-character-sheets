# D&D Basic/Expert/Companion/Masters/Rules Cyclopedia Character Sheet

This is a character sheet for use on Roll20.net with the (5th) edition of Classic Basic Dungeons & Dragons Game as well as retro clones like Dark Dungeons.  Roll some dice like it is 1986!

## Features
This version of the sheet incorporates roll templates, autocalculation of AC, movement rates, WR, and most other derived values.  It does not require access to features of the Dev server or the API.  It includes support for play with the Gazzetter and Creature Crucible series.

### Credit Where Credit is Due
The CSS and much of the layout is lifted from the excellent work of John Myles ([@Actoba](https://app.roll20.net/users/427494/actoba) on roll20) and the 5e Dungeons and Dragons sheet.
