Notes: 
By default Chrome (and likely Firefox) will stop the custom font, at the right of the address bar in your browser is a shield. If you click the shield and select Load unsafe scripts, this will provide access to the custom font.

On pressing the COTERIE button a second set of headings will appear. It is recommended that the ST has one character sheet shared with all players, so they may all type the coterie details into a single sheet. By default Chrome (and likely Firefox) will stop the custom font, at the right of the address bar in your browser is a shield. 

The Banners folder contains many of the images made (in part) by Martinez A. with use of the stiring work available at https://game-icons.net  (See Kudos)
